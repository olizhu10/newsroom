It’s a fake,” the suspects’ uncle, Ruslan Tsarni, told reporters today.\n\nTsarni addressed press outside his home in Montgomery Village, Md., today as a massive manhunt is underway for his nephew, 19-year-old Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, known as “Suspect 2,” who is on the run from police and believed to be heavily armed. Dzhokhar’s 26-year old brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, previously identified by authorities as “Suspect 1,” died in a shootout with police overnight.\n\nLIVE UPDATES: Boston Bombing Suspect Dead in Shootout\n\nTsarni vehemently condemned the alleged actions of both men, calling it “an atrocity.” He said they have brought shame on all Chechens and urged his nephew still at large to surrender to authorities immediately.\n\n“Turn yourself in and ask for forgiveness,” Tsarni beckoned to Dzhokhar in an emotional statement. “He put a shame on this family. He put a shame on the entire Chechnyan ethnicity.”\n\nTsarni, a Muslim and Chechen, said both men were ethnic Chechens, born in Kyrgyzstan, but had lived in the U.S. for several years. The last time he saw the brothers was December 2005, he told reporters, and at that time, neither had terrorism training or displayed any ill will to the U.S.\n\n“Somebody radicalized them, but it wasn’t my brother,” Tsarni said of his brother, the suspect’s father, who lives in Dagestan, a Russian republic. “It’s not my brother, who just moved back to Russia, who spent his life bringing bread to their table. Fixing cars. He didn’t have time or chance or anything. He’s been working, that’s it.”\n\n“I never ever would imagine that somehow the children of my brother would be associated with that,” he continued.\n\nRELATED: Bomb Suspect’s Dad Warns ‘All Hell Will Break Loose’ If Son Dies\n\nEstranged from his brother for a “number of years,” Tsarni separated his family from his nephews’ alleged roles in the bombing on Monday at the Boston Marathon and expressed his love for America.\n\n“Of course we’re ashamed,” he said. “I respect this country, I love this country, this country that gives chance to everyone else to be treated like a human being.”\n\nAnother uncle of the suspects, Alvi Tsarni of Gaithersburg, Md., also expressed disbelief about his nephews’ actions and declared that the nephew that is still on the loose is basically “already dead.”\n\n“They will kill him….we don’t have to worry about this – what’s done is done. He is already dead,” Alvi Tsarni said. “I’m very sorry about what happened. From the first day I was very sorry, who can do this to innocent people…I don’t know what to say, unbelievable, I don’t believe now even now they did this.”\n\nThe city of Boston is on lockdown and transportation has been suspended in the city as the suspect is still at-large and described as willing to die in a battle with police.\n\nPHOTOS: Boston Bombing Suspect Manhunt\n\nABC News’ Arlette Saenz and Cleopatra Andreadis contributed to this report.", "summary": "The uncle of the two Boston Marathon bombing suspects said he was “ashamed” by his nephews’ alleged actions and said that they may have been provoked by “hatred” and “being losers.” “Being losers.  Hatred to those who were able to settle themselves.

The medals, which are given to participants who finish the race, are selling for over $100.\n\nOne medal, advertised as “brand new,” is selling for $306 and had around 25 bids. Another user’s medal is going for $266. The user wrote on his profile that he has run the Boston Marathon several times and sells his medal every year.\n\n“I hold the memories, but I’m not a momento/souvenier [sic] type person. If I keep it, it ends up in a shoebox so I hope someone will buy it that will find it interesting or even inspiring,” the user wrote on the post, adding that he plans to keep $120 of the profit to pay for his entry fee for next year’s marathon and the rest will go to a “first responders or victims fund.”\n\nOne user is selling “a participant’s” used souvenir property storage bag for $31. “Also included are wrappers from two protein bars consumed by the runner prior to the race,” the item description said. It currently has two bids.\n\nA YouTube video, which was posted on Monday after the bombing and surfaced on Reddit, showed a clip of news cameras capturing dozens of people taking marathon jackets out of boxes at a race tent. The video has sparked a huge online debate over whether the people were looting or collecting jackets for runners and victims.\n\nDozens of eBay sellers are also auctioning off local Boston newspapers from this week with headlines about the bombings. Some of the newspapers, including the April 16 edition of the Boston Herald with the “Terror at the Finish Line” headline and the Boston Globe’s “Marathon Terror,” are being sold for around $10.\n\nSome online retailers are using eBay to turn a profit off of the tragedy. Many are offering t-shirts with the phrases “Pray for Boston,” “Prayers for Boston,” “Boston Strong,” “We Remember” and “Never Forget” printed on them, similar to the messages seen on 9/11 memorabilia.\n\nBut one t-shirt seller out of Romania, whose eBay username is tshirtart2.0, is advertising a “RARE Martin Richard Boston Marathon bombing support” t-shirt on eBay for $22.89 – Martin, 8, was one of the three victims killed in the bombing.\n\nA photo of Martin taken in his classroom before he died, which showed him holding a handmade sign that said “No More hurting people Peace” in his child scrawl, made the rounds on social media this week. The t-shirt features those words in Martin’s handwriting on a white background.\n\nABC News reached out to multiple sellers to ask about the items for sale, but none immediately responded.\n\nIn an email to ABC News, eBay said in a statement: “We are deeply saddened by the Boston tragedy and our thoughts and prayers go out to those affected. Out of respect for victims, eBay does not allow listings that graphically portray, glorify or attempt to profit from human tragedy or suffering. eBay’s teams are monitoring related listings to ensure they comply with our policies and also taking into account reports from our community members.

It was the same three men, with no one trailing, as they hit the 24-mile mark.\n\nThey had just run the last mile in 4:36, the fastest of the day, the two Kenyans in front, the Ethiopian less than half a step behind. Kogo was leading, but wasn’t pulling ahead, as he attempted to win Boston in his first-ever attempt at any marathon anywhere.\n\nAs they hit Kenmore Square, none had made his move. There was, in fact, less than a mile to go, and still they ran together.\n\nThey spread out, finally, as they hit the final turn and Boylston Street, with the 23-year-old Desisa pulling away and Gebremariam behind. And so it was Desisa, reaching the finish line first, winning the Boston Marathon in 2:10:22, his arms raised as he crossed.\n\nIt was just the second time Desisa had ever run a marathon.\n\nDesisa joined women’s champion Rita Jeptoo in the winner’s circle. For Jeptoo, it marked her second crown in Boston, and came seven years after her first title in 2006.\n\nIn the wheelchair races, Tatyana McFadden of Maryland won the women’s division in 1:45:25. Japan’s Hiroyuki Yamamoto won the men’s wheelchair division in 1:25:32.\n\nIn the men’s race, Kogo passed Gebremariam to finish second, five seconds behind the winner, with American Jason Hartmann pulling up in fourth place in 2:12:12, pumping his fist to the crowd as he headed down the final stretch of Boylston. It was Hartmann’s second straight fourth-place finish.\n\nAs they had gotten to the Newton hills, it was Dickson Chumba and and Desisa taking the lead, as the pack started to break up. Chumba, who dropped out of last year’s race, did not separate himself, however. Unlike in the women’s race, no one did.\n\nAt the 30-kilometer mark, it was five runners in the lead pack: Chumba, Desisa, Gebremariam, along with Kenya’s Levy Matebo and Kogo.\n\nTwo former winners, meanwhile, dropped back more than 10 kilometers at that point in Korir, who won the 2012 race, and Deriba Merga, who won in 2009.\n\nBut Korir stayed within a few seconds of the leaders, and could be seen just behind them as the men got through the hills and hit the 22-mile mark. He joined the pack again, along with countryman Gebremariam, a real threat at that point. Korir, though, ended up finishing in fifth place in 2:12:30.\n\nFor a day with moderate temperatures — in serious contrast to last year’s 80-plus heat — the pace was relatively slow at the start, and sped up as the men hit the Wellesley hills. Still, the pace was well behind Geoffrey Mutai’s 2011 record of 2:03:02.\n\nAt the start, it was the North American elite men — the United States’s Hartmann and Fernando Cabada, Canada’s Robin Watson — who jumped ahead of the lead pack, followed by the more likely winners. It was just past the 5-mile mark that the group of Ethiopians and Kenyans caught up and took over from the Americans, led by Markos Geneti, Gebremariam, and Merga.\n\nWatson, whose marathon best is 2:13:37, made a move around the 14-mile mark, opening up an approximately seven second lead on the pack. But by the Newton Lower Falls, Watson had rejoined the rest of the leaders, his advantage evaporating quickly.

They were in this country legally, at least a year. They appear to be from Turkey, possibly Chechens from Turkey. That seems to be the nationality here.\" As more information became available, multiple source reported that Dzhokhar was born in Kyrgyzstan and Tamerlan was born in Russia.\n\nJust before 7 a.m. Friday morning, the Associated Press confirmed Williams' reporting and naming Tsarnaev.\n\nBorn July 22, 1993, according to Williams, Tsarnaev attended Cambridge Rindge and Latin School, has a Massachusetts driver's license, and has been in the country for around a decade. CBS reported that he became a naturalized U.S. citizen on Sept. 11, 2012. He is a registered student at UMass Dartmouth, according to the school, where he lived in a dorm.

His brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, died after an overnight shootout with police.\n\nThe brothers come from an ethnic Chechen Muslim family, and Tsarni said the two nephews brought shame to his brother's family. The nephews are sons of Tsarni's brother, and Tsarni last saw his nephews in December 2005.\n\n\"You put a shame on our entire family -- the Tsarnaev family -- and you put a shame on the entire Chechen ethnicity,\" Tsarni said.\n\nWhen asked what provoked the bombing suspects, the uncle stated: \"Being losers, hatred to those who were able to settle themselves -- these are the only reasons I can imagine.\n\n\"Anything else, anything else to do with religion, with Islam, is a fraud, is a fake,\" Tsarni said.\n\n\"Somebody radicalized them, but it's not my brother who just moved back to Russia, who spent his life bringing bread to their table, fixing cars.

Arredondo, a Costa Rican immigrant living in Florida, had just been told his 20-year-old son, Marine Lance Cpl. Alexander Arredondo, was killed in combat in Iraq.\n\nArredondo initially thought the three Marines pulling up to his home were bringing his son to surprise him on his 44th birthday.\n\nArredondo, now 52, recovered from his burns and became a peace activist, traveling the United States with a coffin filled with his son's possessions. This journey brought him to the marathon finish line to watch someone who was running in honor of his son.\n\nArredondo handed out American flags to spectators. He wore two buttons on his shirt with photographs of Alexander and his other son, who committed suicide at age 24.\n\nWhat happened next could have been a scene familiar to his Marine son: A bomb exploded. Arredondo is seen on video, wearing a cowboy hat, helping National Guard troops, police and firefighters wrestle a fence open to allow emergency responders to reach the dozens of wounded people bleeding on the Boston sidewalk.\n\nOnce there, Arredondo found a young man -- perhaps the age of his son -- bleeding from serious leg wounds.\n\n\"I just concentrated on that young man and tied him up, his legs, and talked to him,\" Arredondo said, his hands trembling, in a video posted on YouTube.\n\nHe used part of his clothing to make a tourniquet to slow the blood loss from the man's severed artery.\n\n\"He was conscious,\" Arredondo said. \"I let him know the ambulance is on the way, that it's OK.\"\n\nWhen paramedics arrived, Arredondo helped put the man in a wheelchair. A news photo that has become an iconic image of the tragedy shows Arredondo, his hands covered in blood, running alongside as the man is rushed to an ambulance.\n\n\"There were so many people who lay next to me begging me for help, begging me for help, but I only can help one at a time,\" he said. \"So I just helped that young man.\"\n\nThe man told Arredondo his name, but he couldn't remember it later.\n\nHours later, he still held on to an American flag, now stained with blood.\n\nDr. Vivek Shah was 25 yards away from finishing the 26.2-mile run when the first bomb exploded to his left. He wasn't sure \"whether it was the fireworks gone bad or something that was supposed to happen,\" Shah said Tuesday.\n\n\"Then, after the second explosion went off, we knew something was wrong because all of the spectators and fans started running away from us,\" Shah said.\n\nDeadly attack at Boston Marathon\n\nDeadly attack at Boston Marathon\n\nDeadly attack at Boston Marathon\n\nDeadly attack at Boston Marathon\n\nDeadly attack at Boston Marathon\n\nDeadly attack at Boston Marathon\n\nDeadly attack at Boston Marathon\n\nDeadly attack at Boston Marathon\n\nDeadly attack at Boston Marathon\n\nDeadly attack at Boston Marathon\n\nDeadly attack at Boston Marathon\n\nDeadly attack at Boston Marathon\n\nDeadly attack at Boston Marathon\n\nDeadly attack at Boston Marathon\n\nDeadly attack at Boston Marathon\n\nPhotos: Deadly attack at Boston Marathon\n\nDeadly attack at Boston Marathon\n\nDeadly attack at Boston Marathon\n\nDeadly attack at Boston Marathon\n\nDeadly attack at Boston Marathon\n\nDeadly attack at Boston Marathon\n\nDeadly attack at Boston Marathon\n\nDeadly attack at Boston Marathon\n\nDeadly attack at Boston Marathon\n\nDeadly attack at Boston Marathon\n\nDeadly attack at Boston Marathon\n\nDeadly attack at Boston Marathon\n\nDeadly attack at Boston Marathon\n\nDeadly attack at Boston Marathon\n\nDeadly attack at Boston Marathon\n\nDeadly attack at Boston Marathon\n\nDeadly attack at Boston Marathon\n\nPhotos: Deadly attack at Boston Marathon\n\nPhotos: Deadly attack at Boston Marathon\n\nDeadly attack at Boston Marathon\n\nDeadly attack at Boston Marathon\n\nDeadly attack at Boston Marathon\n\nDeadly attack at Boston Marathon\n\nDeadly attack at Boston Marathon\n\nDeadly attack at Boston Marathon\n\nDeadly attack at Boston Marathon\n\nDeadly attack at Boston Marathon\n\nDeadly attack at Boston Marathon\n\nDeadly attack at Boston Marathon\n\nDeadly attack at Boston Marathon\n\nDeadly attack at Boston Marathon\n\nDeadly attack at Boston Marathon\n\nDeadly attack at Boston Marathon\n\nDeadly attack at Boston Marathon\n\nDeadly attack at Boston Marathon\n\nDeadly attack at Boston Marathon\n\nDeadly attack at Boston Marathon\n\nDeadly attack at Boston Marathon\n\nDeadly attack at Boston Marathon\n\nDeadly attack at Boston Marathon\n\nSport events and terror attacks worldwide\n\nSport events and terror attacks worldwide\n\nSport events and terror attacks worldwide\n\nSport events and terror attacks worldwide\n\nSport events and terror attacks worldwide\n\nSport events and terror attacks worldwide\n\nSport events and terror attacks worldwide\n\nSport events and terror attacks worldwide\n\nShah's story represents the heroism of many other medical professionals who were close by when the terror began: doctors, nurses and paramedics who were running, spectators in the stands or waiting at the finish line to treat exhausted runners.\n\nSources: Bombs were likely in pressure cookers\n\n\"My whole family was on that side where the explosions had gone off,\" Shah said. \"So I started running towards where the bombs had gone off to check on my family and see if there was anything I could do to help.\"\n\nWhat he found on the sidewalk was beyond anything he's seen as an orthopedic surgeon.\n\n\"It's nothing that you can ever describe,\" he said. \"In all of my medical training, I've never seen anything like the amount of trauma I saw yesterday on the sidewalk there.\"\n\nWhen Shah reached the wounded, he was not alone. \"By the time I got there, there were so many first responders and volunteer physicians,\" he said. \"I've never seen anything like it in terms of the quickness of the response to that tragedy.\"\n\nTime is vital in saving lives, according to CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta. Doctors call the first 60 minutes the \"golden hour\" in trauma response, he said.\n\nWithin the first 15 minutes, 15 patients were at Brigham and Women's Hospital, a Level I trauma center, Gupta said. Seven operating rooms were immediately cleared for the nine patients needing surgery, he said.\n\nJoe Andruzzi could be called a hero even before Monday. The former New England Patriots lineman helps children with brain cancer and their families pay for their treatments through his foundation. The Joe Andruzzi Foundation had a team of runners in the Boston Marathon to raise money to help more patients.\n\nAndruzzi, who was near the finish line when the bombs exploded, rushed to help, along with many others. When football fans recognized him in photos, carrying a wounded woman to a triage tent, Andruzzi was quick to downplay his role.\n\n\"While I appreciate the interest in hearing our perspective on today's horrific events, the spotlight should remain firmly on the countless individuals -- first responders, medics, EMTs, runners who crossed the finish line and kept on running straight to give blood, and the countless civilians who did whatever they could to save lives,\" he said in a statement Monday. \"They were the true heroes. Our thoughts and prayers go out to all those affected by this senseless tragedy.\"\n\nAndruzzi knows heroes. His brothers were New York firefighters involved in the September 11, 2001, World Trade Center attack.\n\nA Northeastern University student seriously wounded by shrapnel from the first blast is searching for her personal hero, a man she knows only as Tyler. Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick is helping the woman, whom he met at Tufts Medical Center, to find Tyler.\n\nVictoria -- he didn't give her last name -- was scared and, \"as she described it, hysterical\" when a firefighter carried her to the medical tent near the finish line, Patrick said at a news conference Tuesday.\n\n\"There was a person who helped calm her down, who described himself as an Army sergeant, an Afghanistan vet,\" Patrick said. \"I don't know whether he was assigned to medical tent or, like so many people there and elsewhere in the commonwealth, just jumped in to help.\"\n\nTyler helped Victoria in a way few people could.\n\n\"One of things he said to her to calm her down was to show her his own shrapnel wound or scar from ... when he was in Afghanistan,\" he said.\n\nAn ambulance took Victoria to Tufts Medical Center, but her memory of Tyler followed.\n\n\"Victoria very, very much wants to thank Tyler personally,\" Patrick said. \"So, if Tyler is out there and listening or reading your reports, we would love to hear from Tyler so that we can connect him to Victoria.\"\n\nCall the governor's office, Tyler. The number is 617-725-4000.\n\nCNN's Sarah Aarthun contributed to this report.", "summary": "People near the Boston Marathon finish line when two bombs exploded became heroes Monday.", "compression": 122.4, "coverage": 1.0, "density": 7.1333333333, "compression_bin": "high", "coverage_bin": "high", "density_bin": "mixed"}

The impact was so powerful, it whipped the limp flags straight out as if they were caught in a hurricane.\n\nIt also knocked 78-year-old runner Bill Iffrig to the ground.\n\nGet up-to-the-minute updates on CNN.com's live blog\n\n\"I was just approaching the last straightaway to the finish line, and I had a good day and was feeling really good, and I got down to within about 15 feet of the finishing apron and just tremendous explosion, sounded like a bomb went off right next to me,\" Iffrig said.\n\n\"The shock waves just hit my whole body and my legs just started jittering around. I knew I was going down,\" he said.\n\nIffrig was not seriously injured. But trails of blood, severed arms and legs and other body parts littered the scene nearby.\n\nAt least 144 people were hospitalized, with at least 17 in critical condition and 25 in serious condition, officials said. At least eight of the patients are children.\n\nA terrorism expert briefed on the investigation said doctors are \"pulling ball bearings out of people in the emergency room,\" suggesting the bombs were designed to propel shrapnel.\n\nBut Dr. Ron Walls of Brigham and Women's Hospital, which received 31 patients, said the debris found in some patients' wounds did not appear to be from ball bearings.\n\n\"Everything we saw was sort of ordinary ambient material that could have been propelled by the blast but was not added to the device,\" Walls said. \"It was not the kind of things that would be added to a device to make it more injurious than it otherwise would be.\"\n\nAt Massachusetts General Hospital, several patients suffered from injuries to lower limbs that will require \"serial operations\" in the coming days, trauma surgeon Peter Fagenholz said Monday night.\n\nHe said the most serious wounds \"have been combined, complex lower injuries that involve blood vessels, bone and tissue.\"\n\nNumerous patients had to have limbs amputated, Fagenholz said.\n\n\"Just like\" going back to Iraq\n\nNurses Stephen Segatore and Jim Asaiante were stationed near the finish line, expecting to treat the usual ailments from runners -- cramps and dehydration.\n\nSuddenly, they found themselves in a battlefield, with blood and debris everywhere.\n\n\"For me, it was just like going back to being in Iraq in 2006-2007,\" said Asaiante, an Army captain who served an 18-month tour.\n\n\"I heard the first IED, and I know there's never one. The bad guys always set up two or three\" improvised explosive devices, he said.\n\nThe plumes of smoke and images of bloodied victims running down streets also triggered haunting memories of the terrorist attacks of 9/11.\n\nTami Hughes had just crossed the finish line and was looking for her husband when she heard a deafening explosion.\n\n\"I didn't know if it was a small aircraft going into the building,\" Hughes said. \"I turned around and immediately saw the whitish-brownish smoke billowing up four or five stories and I couldn't believe that, you know, could it be a bomb?\n\n\"And I stared at it and about five or seven seconds later, when the second one went off, I knew immediately that it was something coordinated or organized, because I had been ... down in the financial center, 9/11. So you immediately go back to those moments where OK, where is the third one going to be?\"\n\nInvestigators don't know who was behind the attack, or whether it was spawned domestically or from afar. But federal authorities are classifying it as an act of terrorism.\n\nA federal law enforcement official said both bombs were small, and initial tests showed no C-4 or other high-grade explosive material, suggesting that the packages used in the attack were crude explosive devices.\n\nThe explosions went off near the finish line at about 4 hours and 9 minutes into the race, within a 10-minute window of the average finish time for the marathon.\n\nBut the fact that the blasts took place near the end of the race \"seems to indicate this was not geared toward maximum damage,\" said a former federal law enforcement official who now works in the intelligence community.\n\n\"It may speak volumes about the (level of) planning that went into this,\" the source said. \"It raises questions ... why didn't the bombs go off when the crowd was packed in like sardines when the winners were crossing the finish line? It could mean the people behind it couldn't get access to the area when they originally intended.\"\n\nOfficials have no suspect in custody, but many people are being questioned, Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis said.\n\nInvestigators warned police to be on the lookout for a \"darker-skinned or black male\" with a possible foreign accent in connection with the attack, according to a law enforcement advisory obtained by CNN. The man was seen with a black backpack and sweatshirt and was trying to get into a restricted area about five minutes before the first explosion, the lookout notice states.\n\nLondon Marathon security plans to be reviewed\n\nDavis said authorities found at least one other explosive device that they were dismantling.\n\nBut Rep. Bill Keating, D-Massachusetts, said two undetonated devices were found.\n\nOne was discovered at a hotel on Boylston Street near the bomb site, and another was found at an undisclosed location, said Keating, a member of the House Homeland Security Committee. He called the bombing a \"sophisticated, coordinated, planned attack.\"\n\nThe unexploded devices could provide a treasure trove of information such as fingerprints and indications of the bomb maker's design, said the former federal law enforcement official.\n\nLate Monday night, authorities said they were still getting reports about suspicious packages, but some may be abandoned belongings left by fleeing spectators.\n\nDavis said while no new devices had been found so far, he is \"not prepared to say we're at ease at this point in time.\"\n\nCNN staff in Boston, New York, Atlanta and Washington contributed to this report.", "summary": "Two explosions rocked the finish line at the Boston Marathon on Monday, killing three and wounding at least 144 people", "compression": 79.9047619048, "coverage": 0.8571428571, "density": 2.2857142857, "compression_bin": "high", "coverage_bin": "medium", "density_bin": "mixed"}

(Image credit: Getty Images via @daylife)\n\nThe Boston metropolitan area woke to a massive manhunt and shuttered cities this morning as police chased a 19-year-old fugitive they say is one of the two men responsible for Monday’s bombings at the Boston Marathon.\n\n“This is an ongoing situation,” Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis told reporters in an 8 AM press conference. Residents of Boston and all the surrounding communities have been asked to “shelter in place,” as hundreds of police and federal officers flood the area. Subways, buses, schools and businesses were ordered closed.\n\nShortly before 9 AM, television feeds showed police surrounding a home in Watertown, the community at the heart of the search. A SWAT team and armored car had been summoned, The Boston Globe reported.\n\nPolice identified the surviving bomb suspect as Dzhokhar A. Tsarnaev, who had been living in Cambridge. His brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, was killed in a wild overnight shootout with police just after 2 AM. The AP reported they were originally from the Russia region near Chechnya, and lived in Cambridge for at least 10 years.\n\nLast night’s violence started when a MIT police officer responded to a report of a robbery in Kendall Square near the school’s campus around 10:30 PM. According to reports, he was shot multiple times by the robbers and died.\n\nAccording to The Boston Globe, the two men hijacked a black Mercedes SUV, and headed West from Cambridge along Memorial Drive, an urban highway that runs parallel to the Charles River across from Boston. Police pursued them to Watertown, a small city adjacent to Cambridge. In a standoff with police in Watertown, media reports say, the suspects opened fire on police, quoting witnesses as saying hundreds of rounds were fired by both sides, and a bomb was detonated. An MBTA transit officer was wounded in the firefight, as one of the suspects. He later died, according to reports.\n\nDzhokhar A. Tsarnaev, left, is still at large, police say. His brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, right, was killed.\n\nThe New York Times quotes an eyewitness as saying that the surviving suspect got back in the SUV “put the pedal to the metal” and drove through the phalanx of police to escape the scene. He is still on the loose, police say. They have warned area residents to remain in their homes.\n\nAt 5:46 AM, the governor suspended all public transportation services in the Boston metro region “as a safety measure” according to a spokesman. No vehicle traffic will be allowed in or out of Watertown, police said.\n\n“We believe this to be a terrorist,” Davis said. “We believe this to be a man who’s come here to kill people. We need to get him into custody.”\n\nVideo footage of the scene in Watertown shows an army of police and federal officers swarming into the town of 32,000 residents, which lies just to the West of Cambridge. In a press briefing at dawn, a police spokesman said the two men involved in last night’s violence were the two men responsible for the bombings, which killed 3 and wounded 170 on Monday. Yesterday, images of the two were released by the FBI.\n\nPresident Obama met just before 10 AM in the White House Situation Room with his national security team to discuss the events in Boston and Watertown, according to a White House press pool report.", "summary": "Police flooded Watertown, Massachusetts, hunting door to door for one of two suspects in Monday&#39;s Boston bombing.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.\n\nSEAN HANNITY, HOST: Now to someone who knows all too well what the aftermath of a tragedy like this is like, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani. Who can forget his incredible leadership during America's darkest hours. He rallied a city and a country in the aftermath of 9/11 and worked tirelessly to get the city and its people back on its feet.\n\nJust moments ago, I spoke with the mayor about the latest developments and what this means for this investigation.\n\nHANNITY: Joining us now former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani. Mr. Mayor, good to see you.\n\nRUDY GIULIANI, FORMER NYC MAYOR: Hi, Sean. How are you?\n\nHANNITY: It would be foolish if we don't look at the ricin mail as connected, right?\n\nGIULIANI: I was taught you investigate by not excluding coincidences. When you have a coincidence, it's probably connected. If it isn't connected, you can find out. All of a sudden getting something like in this sent to the United States Senate, you have to start wondering, is this something being triggered here, something going on? It may turn out not to be so, but it's worth investigating it from that point of view.\n\nHANNITY: We have all this break news tonight and I'm not sure how to interpret it. But good news I think in terms of the investigation. WAGA, our affiliate out of Atlanta, has what they believe is the pressure cooker that they got the tape of, and there it is up on the screen. Certainly that could be helpful to the police.\n\nGIULIANI: Right. Tracing where it came from and trying to get back to who did it. The bad news is they let go of the guy that they thought was connected to this. Now, I mean that means they spent the first day, which is a critical day in any terrorism or murder investigation, they spent the day apparently chasing a wrong lead. Now maybe it isn't a wrong lead. Maybe they don't have enough and they are letting him go and they want to see what the heck he does. It's hard to tell because we don't have any of the information they have inside the investigation.\n\nHANNITY: One of the things interesting to me, because we have so many more surveillance cameras, especially in a place of Copley Square, it would be the equivalent of Times Square in New York.\n\nHANNITY: So we have more than we ever had. The interesting thing is they did use these bomb-sniffing dogs, which might shorten that timeline in terms of where they have to look.\n\nGIULIANI: Right. This was put in right before the bomb actually went off.\n\nYou would hope one of those cameras picked it up. You have actually three sets of cameras you are talking about here. You got the government cameras, the ones that are up there all the time. You have the television networks that were covering the marathon, one doing complete coverage.\n\nHANNITY: Right at the finish line.\n\nGIULIANI: And then you have all the people with their camcorders taking pictures of their father, uncle, brother, their son. That's what they are calling for tonight. They are asking for those people to bring those in. I remember solving a couple cases that way when I was with the U.S. attorney's office. All of a sudden somebody had a picture of something and, wow, it proved the case.\n\nHANNITY: What do we make? WHDH also, I believe this is the second bombing that went off, we will put it up on the screen next to where the mailbox is, if you look really, really closely here. They suspect that may very well be the second bomb. Now, if that's the case, and again, as you are pointing out, that would be another lead.\n\nHANNITY: Now we just -- with law enforcement, and I would not blame them at all if they didn't tell us -- would they be less inclined to let the American people know whether or not they have an image of who this is?\n\nGIULIANI: They might. They might. Look, suppose I say I've got an image of the guy who did it. What happens to the guy? He takes off like crazy, right? So, I mean, there could be a reason to keep this information confidential if you think you are going to spook the guy who did it and all of a sudden he's going to take off.\n\nSo they have to be allowed to mislead, even though from the point of the press and the public's right to know you say we should know all the facts. But they are looking for murders here. So misleading is a very acceptable part of law enforcement.\n\nHANNITY: There's been a ton of irresponsible -- and I am not going to get into this deep tonight -- speculation on the part of the left. People like Barney Frank, Steny Hoyer.\n\nGIULIANI: I know, hoping it's anti-tax and tax day.\n\nGIULIANI: Look, none of us know who -- what is behind this. Is it ideological? If so, is it an Islamic terrorist or some other kind of ideology? Is it some crazy person? We're going to find out. If you go by the odds, how often have these things been done? Then of course you will lean in the direction of somehow is it Islamic related or Jihadist related, just taking the percentages of bombings of that taken place, one group, another group, another group. But hey, that doesn't prove anything.\n\nHANNITY: And it could be homegrown.\n\nGIULIANI: My hunch is it is homegrown.\n\nHANNITY: Explain what that means when you say homegrown.\n\nGIULIANI: I don't think this is orchestrated by Al Qaeda or any of their off shoots in Africa or places from there. I think if it was, we would have picked it up because it would have to have been communicated internationally and the coverage now is immense. It sounds to me like this was more homegrown, like Major Hassan, like the attack in Britain '05.\n\nI was in Britain a half a block away from the Liverpool Station when that went off. Those were homegrown people, which is why they eluded the British intelligence service, which is the best in the world, because they were looking at people who came from overseas. They weren't looking at their own citizens.\n\nThis is my hunch. I could be absolutely wrong. But if I were investigating this, that's the hunch I would be working on.\n\nHANNITY: The last thing, something you said this morning, you were surprised that we have not seen more of this. Is this a preview of what you think is a coming attraction?\n\nGIULIANI: This was a nightmare that I had and my police department had for at least a month, month and a half after September 11. When the anthrax attack occurred one month after September 11, we were sure that was the shoe that dropped. When the plane that went down two months later in Rockaway, there it is, that's the other attack.\n\nYears we have been waiting for this. We have stopped a lot of it. Our intelligence gathering, our intelligence analysis is much better now under both Bush and Obama than it was before September 11. So we have thwarted a lot of this. But if they decide to do things like this, this is very, very hard.\n\nHANNITY: The U.S. could become Israel. Scary.\n\nGIULIANI: Yes. I mean, who has better defenses than Israel? And they were only able to prevent a certain number of them. If these people are willing to do this, this is going to be very hard to prevent.\n\nHANNITY: Mr. Mayor, thank you so much.\n\nContent and Programming Copyright 2013 Fox News Network, LLC.

But there is no known specific or credible threat against the British race at the moment, a security official said.\n\nThe London Marathon is a hugely popular race. Last year, some 37,500 athletes competed, with many more watching the springtime event.\n\nLondon has long been considered a top target for international terrorists, with the government saying the threat level is \"substantial.\" In 2005, a series of suicide attacks on the public transport system in the British capital killed 52 people.\n\nLondon and mainland Britain also face a moderate threat from Northern Ireland-related terrorism, according to the government.\n\nTwo bombs exploded near the finish of the Boston Marathon on Monday, killing two people, and injuring at least 22 others, race organizers and police said. The situation sparked alarm bells in Britain, where a massive security operation was put in place last summer to protect the successful London Olympics.\n\nChief Superintendent Julia Pendry, police commander for the London race, said Monday that \"a security plan is in place for the London Marathon. We will be reviewing security arrangements in partnership with (the) London Marathon.\"\n\nA police spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to go on the record said the security presence may be increased.\n\nA security official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter, said there are no credible or specific threats against the London Marathon.\n\nThe London race's chief executive, Nick Bitel, said marathon officials contacted the police to discuss security plans \"as soon as we heard the news\" about Boston. He expressed shock and sadness about the situation in Boston, saying \"it is a very sad day for athletics and for our friends in marathon running.\"", "summary": "British police are reviewing security plans for Sunday's London Marathon, the next major international marathon, because of the deadly bombs that hit the race in Boston.", "compression": 12.6333333333, "coverage": 0.9333333333, "density": 15.6666666667, "compression_bin": "low", "coverage_bin": "medium", "density_bin": "extractive"}

"This transcript is automatically generated\n\nAs we reported earlier tonight we do not know if those responsible for today's deadly bombings in Boston more domestic or foreign terrorist joining me now is someone.\n\nWho knows all too well about those who want to harm and kill Americans he is the nation's very first secretary of Homeland Security.\n\nGovernor Tom Ridge welcome back to the program sir I was a little better circumstances of course -- -- You know we always say it may be it sounds cliched.\n\nsecretary but I gotta tell yet we got to be right a 100% of the time.\n\nAnd it's exactly right this is how vulnerable I guess it reminds us how vulnerable we can be.\n\n-- -- your spot on I mean we have to be right all the time and I think mark -- some of the other guests have -- did to another notion.\n\nThat I think it's very important for your audience and then the rest of the country understand.\n\nWe have a tendency and it just in time wrote in the United States of America look at our watches we have watches they have time.\n\n-- the extent that every day goes by we've been very fortunate for almost ten years.\n\nWith the exception of -- didn't -- a couple of other real.\n\nPotentially -- who were able -- apprehended before the explosions occurred we've been very fortunate that this is a global scourge.\n\nAnd sadly it's a reality we have to deal is and debt.\n\nIn spite of all the efforts and I'm confident that they did everything they could to secure as best they could 26 plus miles but at the end of the day.\n\nYou and I both know there are multiple events with thousands if not hundreds of thousands of people all around this country.\n\nOpen space at the -- stadiums gymnasiums it's a target rich environment for the terrorists and we've -- rating for a long time for the next incident and tragically tragically it just happened today in Boston.\n\nGovernor what what do you glean from the information that we do have at this hour what do you glean from the fact that there -- it was about a 142 interval.\n\nBefore the second bomb went off what do you glean from the fact that there -- other devices that work thankfully found by the police department and they were able to detonate them.\n\nIs just doesn't fit any one pattern of any group would you have any look I I know it's speculation but.\n\nWell first blush I don't want to compliment she said we have more questions we have answers and I think that's very important we don't want an answer our own questions until we get more information.\n\nBut you -- my my view has changed just even the past couple of hours we know it was a fairly rudimentary fundamental device mark Furman said.\n\nYou get -- probably compose a similar device -- ingredients in your own room.\n\nWhat I find dead more interesting as we get more information and perhaps more revealing and one time it was two devices and and tour and export I'm detonated.\n\nNow there may be as many as five so then the question becomes was there one person involved unlikely now there seems to be a coordinated attack among how many we don't know -- on the interstate and be intrigued to learn and someday we will know.\n\nWhat is the detonating device.\n\nI mean obviously there was a delay.\n\nAnd if there were five out of -- were detonated that may be good in terms of evidence and -- a thing -- a finger of responsibility.\n\nI'm maybe one of the most significant clothes at the law enforcement community can come up with.\n\nIs it is -- necessarily do we know for a fact it was on a timer or delay or could -- have potentially.\n\nLike our what our military is dealing with in the field in Iraq hidden in Afghanistan could it have been triggered by a cell phone.\n\nWhich by the way I think that law enforcement very wisely turned off in Boston for awhile.\n\nWell I -- to a certain extent you you understand that they are at -- ready I mean they they knew that that was a potential means to detonate the other devices.\n\nAnd it shows you how clued into that notion and that's why they I think they -- put everybody stay up the cell -- I think it's very difficult obviously.\n\nThese are anti personnel devices.\n\nThey're going to kill a few people with maximum severe personal injury as you and -- are talking now there's probably dozens of people in surgery.\n\nAmputations and the like is designed for that purpose and the fact and if it's confirmed that he had five at least five other devices.\n\nPotentially on this route or elsewhere suggest a coordinated attack the detonating device had to be fairly sophisticated.\n\nShould begin to think more and more a relationship between the group responsible -- -- -- perhaps -- something bigger than just a domestic plot perhaps associated with a broader international jihadist organization.\n\nHad to have you interpret mr.\n\nsecretary that -- that and the police are telling us there's no suspect about hospital.\n\nBut there are few people -- we're talking to an all day long live the terminology was there are there is a person of interest.\n\nMy interpretation of it is as a layman is as they've got somebody that perhaps they saw on video backpacks that they are suspicious of.\n\nI believe that that term is used.\n\nAnd I've heard it used a couple of times I can only tell you the context within which I heard it and how we've used.\n\nPoint is someone they thought may have been.\n\nResponsible or have knowledge of the incident if not responsible.\n\nGenerally it is a directed toward someone they think that dead -- be responsible -- it -- for the incident but it's it's so -- you know the PC world.\n\nNobody wants to saving and by the way I don't blame -- right now were four hours after the incident the police are scrambling you know the you've got more resources down there I don't imagine the public could ever truly appreciate.\n\nThe hundreds of people that are working this issue right now not just the police.\n\nWithin the city but the state police the FBI.\n\nThey are probably hundreds if not thousands of people following leads as you and I -- having this conversation so.\n\nAgain if -- at the outset you did directing a lot of questions I'm not getting any answers plus fill in the gaps with facts.\n\nI I think we will amend this certainly things and then we will learn from each instance and a one of the things we learned on 9/11 as you know well.\n\nIs that al-Qaeda for example works in waves.\n\nAnd that is that they want multiple attacks at one time to create the maximum amount of chaos.\n\nSome have said that there seems to be similarities between the London and Madrid bombings mr.\n\nAre -- certain patterns that you you put together with certain groups and some people more likely the claim credit credit than others.\n\nWell we're waiting to see if somebody claims credit for your right to Madrid bombings.\n\nIt in -- bombings in July of 05 I think in London.\n\nOn in public places there one was the underground was a -- to that and the other thing was a public transportation system in Madrid.\n\nSo you you get a sense as we find out more and more information about more and more explosive devices the delay between the first explosion and the second.\n\n-- once we know about the detonating device it has to be more sophisticated perhaps some of us thought initially that this is much.\n\nMore of a coordinated attack and I think -- Davis may have thought within the first hour to after the incident.\n\nOne last question I know here in New York City additional officers immediately.\n\nWere sent out to prominent locations in the city of new York and we also know in DC that the Secret Service shut down Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\nObviously in the nation is on high alert we'll stay on high alert.\n\nWhat that what period of time do you think needs to pass until things in at least in law -- mine begin to slow down calm down.\n\nWell number one I think it's appropriate at certain venues that that we ramp up.\n\nYou add on the additional security it's basically been embedded into our system both public and private sector for ten years.\n\nAnd I think they'll start to stand down.\n\nWhen they get information that enables them to stand down right now I think appropriate safety and security measures have been taken I think it's it's very appropriate they've they've done so.\n\nAnd I can't -- -- -- time -- and maybe -- maybe a week that I had they'll only sound down when they have information.\n\nThat allows them to pull back some of the security.\n\nProtocols that they -- now embedded in the past have 45 hours.\n\nAnd one thing will never forget governors -- a lot of sick twisted evil people and whoever did this.\n\n-- this to inflict the most damage maximum damage.\n\nTo very innocent people and we need to get the bottom of the thank you sir for being with us -- -- -- appreciate -- now as we were --", "summary": "Reaction

That carnage was followed by reports of explosives, gunfire and an arrest in nearby Watertown, Mass., stemming from a carjacking.\n\nIt was unclear early Friday whether the two incidents were linked to Monday’s attack.\n\nThe Boston bombers are considered armed and dangerous, the FBI said, as the intensive manhunt continued for a fourth day.\n\nRELATED: RICHARD WHALLEY USES SOCIAL MEDIA TO FIND WOUNDED PARENTS IN BOSTON\n\n“Somebody out there knows these individuals as friends, neighbors, co-workers or family members of the suspects,” Boston FBI head Richard DesLauriers said at a Thursday news conference.\n\n“Though it may be difficult, the nation is counting on those with information to come forward and provide it to us.”\n\nThe duo — identified only as Suspect 1 and Suspect 2 — strolled one behind the other along a crowded Boylston St. sidewalk on Monday.\n\nClearer than the photos released by the FBI earlier Thursday, Green’s photo shows details such as the number three emblazoned on the man’s white hat.\n\nRELATED: RUNNERS RACE TO AID BOSTON VICTIMS\n\nAn FBI press officer told the Daily News late Thursday that the man in Green’s photo “certainly resembled Suspect 2” and that agents were incorporating it into their investigation. But the spokesman refused to categorically confirm that the man in Green’s photo was Suspect 2.\n\nFIND THE LATEST NEWS ON THE BOMBINGS HERE\n\n“It was one shot and it was the shot that counted,” Green, 49, said of his photo in a phone interview with the Daily News early Friday.\n\nThe details came one day after authorities said the 24-hour-a-day probe, featuring 30 law enforcement agencies, was closing in on the suspected bombers.\n\nRELATED: SECOND VICTIM ID'D IN BOSTON BOMBING\n\nDespite the discovery of the good-quality video — a needle in an ever-growing haystack of evidence — authorities offered no clue as to the motive behind the gruesome attack. And they could not attach a name to either suspect, or offer any clues to their whereabouts.\n\nThe plotters showed no sign of impending malice as they walked mere paces apart, moving in lockstep behind spectators pressed against a nearby railing.\n\nSuspect 1 wore sunglasses and a black hat, which appears to have a Bridgestone Golf logo. Suspect 2 wore a white hat turned backward. Both toted shrapnel-packed homemade bombs tucked inside their backpacks, officials said.\n\nRoughly 13 minutes after the video captured the two men walking together, Suspect 2 was spotted placing his white bag on the street outside a restaurant.\n\nSuspect 2 was carrying the second bomb, which exploded just 12 seconds after the first blast tore into onlookers gathered to cheer on runners reaching the finish line four hours into the marathon. The white male with a large nose was last seen heading west on Boylston St., according to DesLauriers, the Boston FBI chief.\n\nThe FBI had no further information on what happened to Suspect 1, who carried a black backpack, once he peeled away from his co-conspirator.\n\n“Identifying and locating those responsible is now our highest priority,” DesLauriers said.\n\n“That is our focus now. No bit of information, no matter how seemingly small or inconsequential, is too small for us to see,” he said. “We know the public will play a critical role in identifying and locating these individuals.”\n\nThat’s exactly what victim Jeffrey Bauman did Tuesday, his sister told The News.\n\nCsilla Schneider said her brother, a 24-year-old spectator who was photographed Monday being wheeled away from the scene with his lower body mangled and bloody, asked for a pen and paper as soon as he regained consciousness at Boston Medical Center — and proceeded to describe one of the suspects.\n\n“He saw the kid that did it walk up next to him, put down the bag and walk away,” said Schneider, 27. “He said (the bomber) looked him right in the eye.”\n\nDesLauriers said the two suspects remained the only “people of interest” sought for planting the homemade bombs in the mysterious attack.\n\nThe new evidence was made public after investigators viewed thousands of tips and conducted analysis of video and photos collected from security cameras and the public.\n\nA 30-second video clip, culled from security cameras, captured the two men from three different angles. The feds also released a series of photos — some taken from the video.\n\nTechnicians at the FBI lab in Quantico, Va., were also assembling pieces of the pressure cookers used to house the deadly mix of steel shards, BBs and nails.\n\nThe shrapnel, intended to ensure maximum damage, did its grisly job: 13 people lost limbs, including two who became double amputees.\n\nSources told ABC News on Thursday that store owners in Massachusetts and New Hampshire were quizzed about the sale of 1.25-volt batteries that may have been used in the devices.\n\nOn a mobile device?

But one author, who wrote a book on the basis of such an attack, was less surprised than most.\n\nIn 2002, Tom Lonergan, who ran the marathon 17 times from 1983 to 1999, wrote and self-published a book called “Heartbreak Hill: The Boston Marathon Thriller.” In the novel, a terrorist plot to set off a series of bombs during the marathon is thwarted by a homicide detective.\n\nIn an email to the Huffington Post on Tuesday, Lonergan said, “I had an instant, visceral reaction to the events. ‘Oh my God, just as I predicted.’”\n\nIn the subsequent blogpost Lonergan wrote for Huff Post Books, Lonergan said he had the idea for the novel while running the 100th Boston Marathon.\n\n“The world was, as it is now, a tumultuous mess,” Lonergan writes. “And Boston then, as now, provided the largest single day spectator event in any country, 2.5 million spectators lining the course, from Hopkinton to Boston, men, women and children let out of school for the Patriot’s Day holiday.”\n\nLonergan wrote that during the four-plus hours he was running, he worried that bombs may be detonated in the area.\n\n“How easy, I thought, for any terrorist,” Lonergan writes. “An exceedingly soft target, as the experts say.”\n\nAlthough Lonergan said he would not withdraw his book from sale because it represents some of his “finest feelings for the marathon, the city of Boston and the sport of running,” he did find the bombing especially troubling given his foresight.\n\n“I could not help feeling as I saw the news reports on Monday that someone, somehow may have been inspired by my fiction,” he said.\n\nHowever, Huffington Post points out that Lonergan self-published his book through the company iUniverse and Lonergan said the book has not sold many copies.\n\nLonergan, who now works as a part time museum docent in Nantucket, Mass., suffered a knee injury in 2002 and chose to retire from running rather than receive surgery.\n\nIn his blogpost, he suggests the marathon be renamed to honor Martin Richard, the eight-year-old boy who lost his life in the blast, and writes that he may opt to receive surgery after all, so he can participate in next year’s Boston Marathon.\n\nHuffington Post updated its story to address the many negative comments it said it received that wondered if Lonergan was looking for publicity.

An editor at the newspaper said that Lu’s father confirmed his daughter’s death when reporters visited the family home. The editor declined to give his name because he was not authorized to speak to foreign media.\n\nThe Chinese Foreign Ministry and Consulate General in New York are not releasing the victim’s name at the request of the family. But on Tuesday, Boston media quoted a Chinese Consulate General official as saying Chinese national Lu Lingzi was missing in the wake of Monday’s bombings that killed three and wounded more than 170 people.\n\nRELATED: SYMBOL OF BOSTON TRAGEDY REVEALED AS NICOLE GROSS\n\nIn the Chinese-language world of social media, people have been sharing their condolences on what is believed to be Lu’s microblogging account hosted by Sina Weibo, which was last updated Monday with a breakfast photo. By early Wednesday afternoon, more than 14,000 comments were left on the page.\n\nFriends contacted through Sina Weibo have largely declined to speak to media about Lu, saying they were adhering to the wishes of Lu’s family.\n\nLu graduated from a Shenyang high school and studied international trade at Beijing Institute of Technology before she went to the United States to study statistics as a graduate student at Boston University, according to media reports, Lu’s friends and her own Facebook page.\n\nLUPICA: WHOEVER IS BEHIND BOSTON MARATHON BOMBINGS BROUGHT WAR TO AMERICAN HOMELAND\n\nFor the families of the two other victims who lost their lives in what President Obama called an “act of terror,” Tuesday was another excruciating day of mourning.\n\n\"She was the best,\" said Patty Campbell, whose 29-year-old daughter, Krystle, was killed in the attacks. \"You couldn't ask for a better daughter.\"\n\nA native of Arlington, Mass., Campbell had made a tradition of coming to Boston to cheer on the runners as they completed the marathon and had attended this year’s race with her best friend, Karen, who remains hospitalized with serious injuries.\n\nRELATED: FBI INVESTIGATING BOSTON MARATHON BOMBING RECEIVES MORE THAN 2,000 TIPS\n\n“She loved being around people. She was a people lover, even as a little girl,” Lillian Campbell, Krystle’s grandmother, told The Boston Globe. “She always had a lot of friends around her. She loved music, and she loved life, Krystle did. She was always bouncing and always happy.”\n\nKrystle Campbell worked as a restaurant manager. Her father, 56-year-old William Campbell, described her as \"just a very caring, very loving person, and was daddy's little girl.\"\n\nKrystle Campbell and her friend, Karen, were cheering on Karen's boyfriend, who was running in Monday's race.\n\n\"They wanted to take a photograph of him crossing the finish line, but the explosion went off and they were right there,\" William Campbell said. \"It's pretty devastating.\"\n\nKrystle Campbell's friend suffered a severe leg injury.\n\n\"She's very badly hurt, she's all messed up,\" he said. \"Her leg was all destroyed.\"\n\nThe father of 8-year-old Martin Richard now faces the unimaginable burden of grieving his youngest son’s death while caring for his wife and daughter, both of whom remain hospitalized.\n\nRELATED: BOY KILLED IN BOSTON BOMBING'S MESSAGE OF PEACE\n\n“My dear son Martin has died from injuries sustained in the attack on Boston.

I ask that you continue to pray for my family as we remember Martin.\"\n\nMartin’s mother, Denise Richard, underwent brain surgery on Monday, while his 6-year-old sister lost a leg as a result of the bombings.\n\nA candlelight vigil was held Tuesday at St. Anne’s Church in Dorchester to remember the young life taken too soon. Of all the difficult images that the nation was confronted with over the past two days, perhaps one of the most wrenching was that of Martin holding a sign he had made for a school peace rally that read, “No more hurting people.”\n\n\"That little boy will never come home again,'' Dan Aguilar, a neighbor of the Richards’, told The Globe. \"It's still unreal. I have no words. I have no words.''\n\nNeighbors and friends remembered Martin as a vivacious boy who loved to run, climb and play sports like soccer, basketball and baseball.\n\nRELATED: MAN ON ROOF PICTURE GOES VIRAL\n\nHis family was watching Monday's race and had gone to get ice cream before returning to the area near the finish line before the blasts.\n\nDenise Richard works as a librarian at the Neighborhood House Charter School, where Martin was a third-grader and Jane attends first grade. Counselors were being made available to staff and students.\n\n\"I just can't get a handle on it,\" family friend Jack Cunningham said of the boy's death. \"In an instant, life changes.\"\n\nA devastating photo of Martin previously holding a poster calling for an end to violence was widely shared Tuesday.\n\n“No more hurting people. Peace,” is the message held by the boy in his classroom last April — part of a lesson on the shooting of Trayvon Martin, according to a Facebook post by Martin’s teacher, Rachel Moo.\n\nPeople were touched by the image.\n\n“My prayer is that we all live by Martin’s words ... by following his example,” Lucia Brawley, a friend of Moo, posted under Martin’s picture.\n\nA photo of the three Richard children on Halloween in 2009 showed a smiling Martin dressed as Woody from the “Toy Story” films, complete with cowboy hat and sheriff’s badge. Beside him stood Jane, dressed as the film character Jesse, and Henry, dressed as Harry Potter.\n\n“He had that million-dollar smile and you never knew what was going to come out of him,” said Judy Tuttle, a family friend. “Denise is the most spectacular mother that you’ve ever met, and Bill is a pillar of the community. It doesn’t get any better than these people.”\n\nShe recalled having tea recently with Denise Richard while Martin did his homework.\n\n“What a gift,” Tuttle said of Martin. “To know him was to love him.”\n\nKevin Andrews, headmaster at the Neighborhood House Charter School, said the school community was heartbroken by the loss of the third-grader, whom he called “a bright, energetic young boy who had big dreams and high hopes for his future.”\n\nON A MOBILE DEVICE?

It means this was the day after the middle of Boylston St. became as insane as the Middle East.\n\nDr. Carl Conui, a podiatrist who has volunteered in the medical tent at the Boston Marathon for the past 15 years, who is right there as the runners finish to help them with blisters and foot problems and ankle problems, was talking on Tuesday afternoon about what he saw in that tent near the Boston Public Library after the bomb went off a little before 3 p.m.\n\n“I saw blood and gurneys and severed legs at the end of a race that I love,” Conui said. “All of a sudden there was all this movement and all this blood and women in wheelchairs.”\n\nRELATED: SECOND VICTIM ID'D IN BOSTON BOMBING\n\nConui paused and said, “I was in the middle of a war zone. I’m not used to a war zone working as a volunteer at the Boston Marathon.”\n\nThis is what happens when bombs made from pressure cookers spray shrapnel and death not at soldiers, but at innocents there to watch the end of a race, including an 8-year-old boy standing near his father.\n\nPressure-cooker bombs have been used in Afghanistan and Pakistan and India, and one even made it to Times Square a few years ago. And what feels like a thousand years ago in New York City, back in the ’70s, a bomb like this killed a police officer of the city as he tried to disarm it.\n\nRELATED: SECOND VICTIM ID'D IN BOSTON BOMBING\n\nBut now it had made its way to Boylston, the corners of Exeter and Fairfield, after the runners have made the turn from Commonwealth Ave. on Hereford St., for their big moment at the end of the 26.2 miles. This is where they run into the final cheers of the day, sometimes into the arms of loved ones. Only on this day they ran into a war, a war that has now come to Boston the way it came to downtown New York City once, one whose victims are not soldiers who know the risks of what they do and the enemy they face, just innocents, again.\n\n“I don’t remember when it was exactly,” Dr. Carl Conui said on Tuesday. “But somebody came into the tent and said that a child had died.”\n\nNow it was a day later, and he was getting into his car, still parked at Newbury and Exeter, a block from where the world exploded again the day before. Middle of Boylston St., Boston, becoming the Middle East. There were runners everywhere, so many of them proudly wearing their blue-and-yellow Boston Athletic Association windbreakers, walking in that careful day-after way, every single one of them that I spoke to on Tuesday saying that they would be back for the 2014 Boston Marathon, defiant and optimistic at the same time.\n\nPHOTOS: TWO EXPLOSIONS ROCK BOSTON MARATHON FINISH LINE\n\nSo April 16 of 2013 in Boston became Sept. 12 of 2001 in New York, not because there were as many victims and tragedies here, but because you could see them want to be part of a great American city getting back up.\n\nThis time the satellite trucks were everywhere in this part of Boston, Commonwealth and parked near the Public Garden, this city’s Central Park, on Arlington St., as the police opened up Boylston St. a block or two at a time, stopping everybody from the actual crime scene down by Exeter where the bombs went off, where you could see the white Mylar blankets you see draped over runners’ shoulder after the race blowing across the street in the high afternoon winds.\n\nThey did not know who did this, did not yet know who the enemy was in the middle of Boylston St. The runners just knew they were taking this personally the way Boston was taking this personally.\n\nRELATED: LUPICA: BOSTON MARATHON BOMBS SHOW THEY WANT US TO RUN SCARED\n\nI ran into an old friend, Ed Markey, currently running for the U.S. Senate, one of the good guys, across from the Public Garden late Thursday afternoon.\n\n“There’s a reason why we take this personally,” Markey said. “On a day like Patriots’ Day, you have to understand that everybody in Massachusetts feels like they either know somebody running the race or know somebody going to the race. That’s why we feel as if it happened to all of us.”\n\nAnd not just in Massachusetts. This time they — whoever they are — hit Boston as a way of hitting us all.\n\nYou see tulips laid against police barriers at Newbury and Clarendon with this message on them: “Stay strong, Boston.” Before they take down the police barricades at the top of Boylston, let onlookers get a little closer to where it happened, a saxophonist plays a haunting, beautiful version of the national anthem, and the people there stand and applaud.\n\nYou talk to two sisters from Canada, Calgary and Alberta, Virginia Engel and Christina Engel, both of them having run the Boston Marathon on Monday. Virginia smiled and said she was the faster one, but she slowed down to stay with her sister, before they were in that group of runners stopped at the 25-mile mark on Commonwealth Ave. They were told to start moving away from the finish line at the marathon and not toward it.\n\nVirginia Engel said, “This time terrorism was 1 mile away. And if I’d run a little faster, I would have run right into it.”\n\nThis was not terror on the news this time, not terror on a television screen or in the newspaper, not a bomb killing a soldier on the side of the road across the world.

Before long, he said, he heard gunfire. Then explosions. Dr. Schoenfeld called Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, where he works in the emergency room, and told them to prepare for trauma patients for the second time this week.\n\n“I told them to get ready for incoming casualties, because it just sounded pretty violent,” he said in a phone interview on Friday afternoon. “I woke up my wife, told her I had to go to work, put on my scrubs and went to the hospital.”\n\nHe arrived at about 1:10 a.m. Fifteen minutes later, an ambulance carrying Tamerlan Tsarnaev, one of the brothers suspected in the Boston Marathon bombings, pulled up. He was handcuffed but unconscious, gravely wounded and in cardiac arrest, Dr. Schoenfeld said.\n\nAs a throng of police officers looked on, Dr. Schoenfeld and a team of other trauma doctors and nurses began CPR. Dr. Schoenfeld declined to describe Mr. Tsarnaev’s injuries, but The Boston Globe reported that they included burns on his right shoulder and chest and a large wound on his torso.\n\nOfficials have said that Mr. Tsarnaev was injured in a gun battle with the police, who had pursued him and his brother, Dzhokhar A. Tsarnaev, in a car chase from Cambridge to Watertown.\n\n“There was talk before the patient arrived about whether or not it was a suspect,” Dr. Schoenfeld said. “But ultimately it doesn’t matter who it is, because we’re going to work as hard as we can for any patient who comes through our door and then sort it out after. Because you’re never going to know until the dust settles who it is.”\n\nThe trauma team put a breathing tube in Tsarnaev’s throat, Dr. Schoenfeld said, then cut open his chest to see if blood or other fluid was collecting around his heart. Tsarnaev’s handcuffs were removed at some point during the resuscitation attempt, he said, because “when the patient is in cardiac arrest and we’re doing all these procedures, we need to be able to move their arms around.”\n\nThe team was unable to resuscitate him, and pronounced him dead at 1:35 a.m. Only as they prepared to turn the body over to the police did Dr. Schoenfeld look closely at the patient’s face and see that he looked like one of the suspects whose pictures had been released by the F.B.I. hours earlier.\n\n“We all obviously had some suspicion given the really large police presence,” he said, “but we didn’t have a clear identification from the police.”\n\nDr. Schoenfeld, whose emergency room treated a number of people injured in the bombings on Monday, said he had not had time to process what he had been through in the early hours of Friday.\n\n“I can’t say what I’ll be feeling as I reflect on this later on,” he said. “But right now I’m more concerned with everybody who’s still out there and still in harm’s way.”\n\nHe added, “I worry about everybody in the city, that everyone’s going to be O.K.”", "summary": "The Lede is following the aftermath of Monday&#8217;s deadly explosions at the Boston Marathon, which killed three and injured more than 170 on Monday.", "compression": 24.1923076923, "coverage": 0.6153846154, "density": 0.8461538462, "compression_bin": "medium", "coverage_bin": "low", "density_bin": "abstractive"}

The 37,000 runners include many stars, like the British Olympic gold medalist Mo Farah, who is running only the first half of the race.\n\nThe finish line of the event lies within sight of Buckingham Palace on the broad avenue called The Mall. At the starting line, runners are to pause for a 30-second silent commemoration of the victims in Boston, and the organizers say they will hand out black armbands for contestants.\n\nChief Superintendent Julia Pendry, who is in charge of the policing of the London Marathon, said additional deployments would increase the number of officers by 40 percent compared with last year.\n\n“I have increased the number of officers for reassurance patrols by several hundred. It’s about making sure that people who come to London on Sunday feel safe when they are in the city,” she told reporters. “It is a good 40 percent increase on last year on numbers of officers on the ground. We’ve got more search dogs out; we have got more on high-visibility patrols.”\n\nShe did not give a precise figure for the number of officers to be deployed. The number of spectators at the event routinely runs into the hundreds of thousands.\n\nThe British police say they are in close touch with their counterparts in Boston and have received no indication that the attack in the United States is part of a broader conspiracy involving London.\n\n“At this time there is no link whatsoever between the Boston Marathon atrocities and the London Marathon on Sunday,” Chief Superintendent Pendry said. “What we have got is a number of contingencies. I have several contingencies should anything change between now and Sunday; we can then react to anything that should happen.”\n\n“There is no link between the Boston Marathon and the London Marathon, and there is no change to the threat level at this time to London,” she said.\n\n“The message I’d like to give to everybody coming is that we want you to come on Sunday, enjoy coming to watch your family and friends race, but please look after your own belongings because unattended packages will cause us to have more work to do,” Chief Superintendent Pendry said.", "summary": "The deployment of hundreds of additional officers is designed to reassure contestants and spectators after the Boston attacks.", "compression": 28.0526315789, "coverage": 0.8421052632, "density": 1.2631578947, "compression_bin": "medium", "coverage_bin": "medium", "density_bin": "abstractive"}

If the address is not as chic as Newbury Street, which runs parallel, well, Newbury might have more upscale shopping, but it does not have the final three and a half blocks of the Boston Marathon.\n\nAnd yet Boylston Street is no longer simply a festive place where, every third Monday in April, the ache of running 26.2 miles melts into exhausted gratification. With the bombings that killed 3 and wounded more than 170, Boylston joined Oklahoma City and ground zero and Shanksville, Pa., as the latest name on a grim terror roll call.\n\nOn a cloudless early afternoon Wednesday, as word spread of video of a suspect, the finishing area of the marathon remained eerily quiet and vacant, cordoned off by crime-scene tape and metal barricades and the presence of police officers. Investigators in white protective suits walked shoulder to shoulder, carrying wands, searching for minute evidence. One dropped to his hands and knees, face near the ground as if in prayer.\n\nA sense of desertion, of hurried and unplanned removal, accompanied catastrophe and jittery mourning. National flags of the United States, Algeria, Australia and the Bahamas were visible from a block away, still fluttering along the abandoned course. Bottles of water stood on tables, no runners around to drink. A medical tent in which doctors had treated the shattered calm and splintered limbs remained near the finish.\n\n“We’re on the list of some of the most horrendous acts that have happened in this country,” said Paul Norton, 55, a video producer for an insurance company, as he took a lunchtime walk near the finish area. “I think they’ll bounce back. The question is, in what form? There will need to be changes.”\n\nThe challenge, Mr. Norton said, will be to “preserve the spirit of one of the premier events in our city while maintaining heightened security.”\n\nAs happened after the 9/11 attacks and natural disasters like Hurricane Katrina, a familiar attitude of resilience, defiance and commitment to recover has prevailed. Kevin Cullen, a columnist for The Boston Globe, said in a television interview that Boston cared deeply about only three things: “Politics, sports and revenge.”\n\nEstablished in 1897, a year after the modern Olympics began, the Boston race is considered the oldest continual marathon. A feeling expressed by many is that the race will not be diminished by the bombings, and will return bigger and stronger. This optimism stems, in part, from the notion that because the marathon is held every year, it provides an annual opportunity for renewal and replenishment.\n\nAmby Burfoot, 66, who won the 1968 Boston Marathon, encouraged organizers to enlarge the field in a celebratory run next year, as they did for the 100th running of the race in 1996. A number of runners said they planned to return in 2014, many to finish what they were not allowed to complete when the race was halted Monday, and to show gratitude for volunteers and residents who received widespread praise for their assistance in the tumult of the bombings.\n\n“Are we going to let whoever did this defeat us, or are we going to rise above it?” said Steve Michalski, 43, who works with autistic children in Salt Lake City and who finished Monday’s race before the bombings.\n\nNoting that participants in Boston must run qualifying times to enter and that marathon running requires extreme dedication with months of training, Mr. Michalski said: “These people have a drive to succeed and take on challenges. They are not easily scared off.”\n\nAs he watched investigators near the finish line, Mark Sandham said he felt certain that one or more surviving victims would enter Boston in the future, either in a wheelchair or on foot, and that it would be a triumphant indication of the city’s resolve.\n\n“You know it’s going to happen,” said Mr. Sandham, 50, an insurance underwriting manager. “It’s going to be a huge emotional moment.”", "summary": "Some runners expressed their hope that the Boston Marathon would retain its spirit and come back from the bombings bigger and stronger.", "compression": 37.9130434783, "coverage": 0.8260869565, "density": 1.6086956522, "compression_bin": "high", "coverage_bin": "medium", "density_bin": "mixed"}

Frank Thaleiser, who is organizing the race in Germany, said 400 police officers would be on duty guarding the 15,300 runners and diverting traffic.\n\nIn London, the police are on alert because of the funeral Wednesday of Margaret Thatcher, the former British prime minister. The city’s marathon, which nearly 36,000 runners finished last year — about a third more than in Boston — winds through central London and typically attracts hundreds of thousands of spectators.\n\nHugh Robertson, the sports minister, said he was absolutely confident the course could be protected. Nick Bitel, the chief executive of the London Marathon, added that organizers had “fairly detailed contingency plans which one hopes can deal with anything that occurs.”\n\nThe Tour de France, held in July, presents a much wider-ranging challenge, covering more than 2,000 miles.\n\nWhile the French government does not publicize most of its security measures for the cycling race, the police presence approaches the scale of an Olympic Games. Last year, about 13,000 members of the Gendarmerie Nationale, the force that provides rural policing, helped protect the three-week race at various times.\n\nWhen the Tour briefly entered Spain in 2007, ETA, the Basque separatist group, detonated two bombs along the road after the riders had passed.\n\nNew York City Marathon organizers and the city police have more time to prepare because that race is in November. But it is one of the largest road races in the world, with nearly 60,000 runners registered and about two million spectators.\n\nSecurity experts expect the police to add security near the most susceptible parts of the course, including the starting line at the foot of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge in Staten Island and the finish line in Central Park, which are already heavily guarded. Spectators could see more random searches and displays of force by the police to keep would-be attackers off guard.\n\n“It’s a huge challenge and one that’s virtually impossible to protect from start to finish,” said Robert S. Tucker, the chief executive of T&M Protection Resources. “This is like calling an audible in a football game. We’re going to have to deal with it differently.”\n\nThe police in New York will face their first test this weekend when two smaller races will be run in Manhattan, including the 9/11 Memorial 5K in Lower Manhattan and a four-mile run in Central Park. Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said Tuesday that his department would evaluate its security plan for patrolling the marathon and other road races based in part on what happened in Boston.\n\n“We don’t want to necessarily fight yesterday’s war,” Kelly said at a news conference with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. “We want to take a fresh look at what we are doing. The marathon is 26 miles long so, you know, there are points of vulnerability by definition. There are going to be.”\n\nThe mayor underscored the difficulty in preparing for potential threats. “The one thing that we can be reasonably sure of is, they are not going to do the same thing two times in a row, which makes protecting the public that much more challenging,” he said.\n\nWhile security experts are confident that the police can adjust, challenges remain. New York Road Runners and many other race organizations are nonprofit groups that lack the resources to vastly expand their security budgets. Last year the police in New York started to charge race organizers for the cost of their security details, which were passed on to runners in the form of higher entry fees. If police charges rise significantly, the number of entrants may decline, which could hurt the city’s economy.\n\nMary Wittenberg, the chief executive of New York Road Runners, said in a statement that “the safety and security of all New York Road Runners’ races is and will always be our top priority. We will continue to work hand in hand with the City of New York and the N.Y.P.D. as we plan for upcoming events.”\n\nYet complications remain, especially the handling of the thousands of bags that runners bring to races. John Korff, who organizes the New York City Triathlon, said the police had asked participants to put their belongings in clear plastic bags to make it easier for them to be inspected, something that is also required at the marathon. He expected other requests from the police, who are likely to take other steps out of view.\n\n“With any race, the police look at your security plan and they do what they have to based on what you’re doing,” Korff said. “New York City is probably 10 steps ahead of everywhere else, and we don’t know about nine of the steps.”\n\nIn some ways, the New York City Marathon is different from other races because the police here have been preparing for potential terrorist attacks on large sporting events for more than a decade. Before the marathon in November 2001, Road Runners was asked to give law enforcement officers a list of the participants that could be checked against lists of known criminals. Security checks were run on all volunteers, coaches, managers and reporters.\n\nThe Coast Guard patrolled the harbor, especially near the bridges that the runners pass over. Trash cans along the route were removed, and the police were placed on rooftops along the course. Many of these measures continue.\n\nUnlike in Boston, where the finish line was largely open to the public, access to the finish line in Central Park is tightly controlled. Last year, Road Runners gave participants the choice of not leaving a bag at the starting line, an option that may have to be expanded this year.\n\n“You’re going to see a heightened diligence at sporting events because that’s the hand that you’ve been dealt,” said Patrick Brosnan, the president of a risk consulting firm that works with sports teams and venues. “Each one is a Rubik’s cube.”\n\nAlan Cowell contributed reporting from London, Ian Austen from Ottawa and Wendy Ruderman from New York.", "summary": "Race organizers in London and New York may consider additional safety measures after the bombings in Boston.", "compression": 78.9444444444, "coverage": 0.8333333333, "density": 1.8333333333, "compression_bin": "high", "coverage_bin": "medium", "density_bin": "mixed"}

Deploring what he called a “heinous and cowardly act,” Mr. Obama said that “the American people refuse to be terrorized.”\n\nBy moving quickly to put Mr. Obama on the record, the White House appeared intent not to repeat the messy chain of events after the assault on the diplomatic mission last year in Benghazi, Libya, which killed four Americans, including Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens.\n\nIn that case, critics accused the White House of initially playing down the terrorism links for political reasons during a hard-fought presidential campaign, although Mr. Obama, in a statement at the time that was widely overlooked, did characterize the attack as an “act of terror.”\n\n“My hunch is, that’s why he came back out today,” said Peter D. Feaver, a professor at Duke University and a national security aide to former President George W. Bush. “They are trying to do a better job in the messaging than after Benghazi, where their reluctance to be clear and candid in what they were facing left them open to criticism.”\n\nBut the White House did not move fast enough to satisfy some Republican critics, who seized on the president’s hesitancy as an opportunity to portray him as somehow disengaged on the issue.\n\nSenator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, echoed a sentiment voiced by many of her colleagues when she said, “I was puzzled yesterday that the president did not describe it as a terrorist attack right off the bat since it was so evidently a terror attack.”\n\nTo showcase its response, the White House has circulated photos of Mr. Obama’s briefings with the director of the F.B.I., Robert S. Mueller; the secretary of homeland security, Janet Napolitano; his chief counterterrorism adviser, Lisa Monaco; and other officials.\n\nThe White House appeared to have learned from episodes like the failed plot to blow up a Northwest Airlines jetliner on Dec. 25, 2009, when the president was heavily criticized for saying nothing publicly for three days about the event.\n\nA month before that plot, Mr. Obama was faulted for his initially subdued response to a shooting rampage at Fort Hood, Tex., in which Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan killed 13 active and retired soldiers.\n\n“There is no doubt that they draw from the lessons of Fort Hood, Benghazi and Christmas Day,” said Tommy Vietor, a former spokesman for the National Security Council.\n\n“When something happens domestically, he has to go out quickly,” Mr. Vietor said. “But when you don’t know what happened, it doesn’t make sense for the president to say too much.”\n\nWhile Mr. Obama described the attack as terrorism, he offered few other details. “What we don’t yet know, however, is who carried out this attack or why, whether it was planned and executed by a terrorist organization, foreign or domestic, or was the act of a malevolent individual,” the president said. “That’s what we don’t yet know.”\n\nInstead, Mr. Obama paid tribute to the police, rescue teams, doctors and others who responded to the harrowing scene at the Boston Marathon. He described images of runners finishing the race and then sprinting to hospitals to donate blood as well as spectators who tore off their clothing to fashion tourniquets for the wounded.\n\n“The American people refuse to be terrorized,” Mr. Obama said. “If you want to know who we are, what America is, how we respond to evil, that’s it: selflessly, compassionately, unafraid.”\n\nBy sticking to his schedule, the president also sought to project an air of steadiness. After leaving the briefing room, he had lunch with the crown prince of Abu Dhabi, Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, and honored the winner of the Nascar racing championship, Brad Keselowski.\n\nStanding next to a racecar emblazoned with ads, Mr. Obama promised to hunt down the Boston bombers, but said Americans would not let terrorism “get in the way of our lives.”", "summary": "President Obama labeled the Boston blasts a terrorist attack for the first time, but he said officials did not know whether it was the work of foreign or domestic groups or individuals.", "compression": 26.7058823529, "coverage": 0.8529411765, "density": 1.6764705882, "compression_bin": "medium", "coverage_bin": "medium", "density_bin": "mixed"}

The city that shows up to cheer on thousands of runners doesn’t really know or care much about who wins; there are no sides to root for or against. Those who stand on the sidelines — as they have done in Boston since 1897 — come to celebrate runners from around the world. The country or neighborhood of origin of the competitors matters far less than their stamina.\n\nOn Monday, the weather for the 117th running of the Boston Marathon was cloudy and a little chilly — just the way runners like it. Three hours after the winners had broken the tape, there were still many runners on the course, and hundreds of spectators on the sidewalk, when an explosion rocked the finish-line area on Boylston Street, across from the main viewing stand. For a brief second, the flags of scores of nations were bent downward by the blast.\n\nA few marathoners were knocked over by the force of the explosion. Some runners, locked in their trance, kept going until they realized something horrific had just happened. When they turned back, they said they heard the screams and wails, saw the column of rising smoke, and then the blood and limbs of victims. There was broken glass and agony everywhere.\n\nFifteen seconds after the first one, there was another explosion a few blocks away. It was clear this was not a random event but another concerted effort to kill and maim innocent Americans, just because they had gathered in a vulnerable spot on a day when no one’s mind was on terror. The police confirmed that bombs were responsible for the mayhem; three more unexploded devices were found elsewhere around the city. At least three people died — one of whom was 8 years old — and dozens more were injured, some severely.\n\nIt could be a while before officials determine which malevolent ideology was behind this attack. President Obama vowed to track down the perpetrators and bring them to justice, praising Boston as a “tough and resilient town” that will take care of itself and will be taken care of by the country. “The American people will say a prayer for Boston tonight,” he said.\n\nThe simple joy of a 26.2-mile run was shattered on Monday. But the marathon will be back next year, no matter how much security is required, and the crowds should yell twice as loudly.

Today is Friday, April 19, and this is the World Wrap, brought to you by @dwbronner and @clarerrrr.\n\nSWAT teams enter a suburban neighborhood to search an apartment for the remaining suspect in the Boston Marathon bombings in Watertown, April 19, 2013.\n\nBoston bombing suspect’s webpage exalts Islam and Chechnya. Boston bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev posted links to Islamic websites and others calling for Chechen independence on what appears to be his page on a Russian language social networking site:\n\nHe has posted links to videos of fighters in the Syrian civil war and to Islamic web pages with titles like “Salamworld, my religion is Islam” and “There is no God but Allah, let that ring out in our hearts.” He also has links to pages calling for independence for Chechnya, a region of Russia that lost its bid for secession after two wars in the 1990s.\n\nPolice are frantically searching for the 19-year-old, who escaped a shootout that killed his older brother and second suspect in the bombings that killed three and wounded 176 people on Monday. The suspects in the Boston Marathon bombings are ethnic Chechen brothers who spent much of their lives away from the breakaway Russian republic and showed few outward signs of radicalism in the United States. One MIT police officer was killed in the shootout and one transit police officer was wounded. Follow live updates here.\n\nPolice arrest Pakistan’s Musharraf. Police took former Pakistani president Pervez Musharraf into custody after a judge ordered his arrest on Thursday:\n\nA magistrate had raised the stakes earlier on Friday when he ordered Musharraf be placed under house arrest for two days before he is due to appear in court on allegations of illegally detaining judges during a crackdown on the judiciary in 2007. Musharraf is accused of violating the constitution by placing judges under house arrest after he sacked the chief justice and imposed emergency rule.\n\nThe retired army chief’s callous treatment by the courts marks a shift for Pakistan, which has spent half its history under military rule and does not usually subject military officials to common law. Musharraf’s return to Pakistan and attempt to run for office came as a surprise to many, and the call for his arrest delivered another blow to an unlikely political career.\n\nSouth America gets on board with Venezuela’s new president. The Union of South American Nations (Unasur) offered Venezuelan President-elect Nicolas Maduro their support in a last-minute meeting held hours before he is sworn in. Tensions eased in Venezuela a day after the country’s National Electoral Council agreed to audit 46 percent of electronic votes it has not yet checked:\n\nThe governments of Brazil, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Bolivia and Argentina, among others, had recognized Maduro’s victory before the summit. But two of the more moderate countries – Peru and Brazil – were especially concerned about growing polarization in Venezuela and how it might hurt governance, diplomats and lawmakers said.\n\nProtests erupted in Venezuela after Maduro won the election by a slim margin, surprising pollsters who expected a landslide win and prompting Capriles supporters to claim foul play. The Venezuelan government said eight have been killed in post-election violence. The EU recommended an audit of the votes, and the U.S. refused to recognize the results. Capriles is satisfied with the Council’s decision, saying that “with this, we’re where we want to be.”\n\nNota Bene: The Beach for Everyone project offers handicapped children the opportunity to relax in the sun and play in the sand on Rio de Janeiro’s beaches.\n\nPricked prophylactics - Ghana faces a major public health crisis after finding that 1 million condoms imported from China are faulty.

The fiery twin blasts took place about 10 seconds and about 100 yards apart, knocking spectators and at least one runner off their feet, shattering windows and sending dense plumes of smoke rising over the street and through the fluttering national flags lining the route.  WBZ-TV reported late Monday that law enforcement officers were searching an apartment in the Boston suburb of Revere.  Massachusetts State Police confirmed that a search warrant related to the investigation into the explosions was served Monday night in Revere but provided no further details.  Some investigators were seen leaving the Revere house early Tuesday carrying brown paper bags, plastic trash bags and a duffel bag.  The person said the boy's mother and sister were also injured as they waited for his father to finish the race.  Boston Police Commissioner Edward Davis asked people to stay indoors or go back to their hotel rooms and avoid crowds as bomb squads methodically checked parcels and bags left along the race route.  The police commissioner said that it may have been caused by an incendiary device but that it was not clear whether it was related to the bombings.  Runners in the medical tent for treatment of dehydration or other race-related ills were pushed out to make room for victims of the bombing.  Boston Athletic Association president Joanne Flaminio previously said there was &quot;special significance&quot; to the fact that the race is 26.2 miles long and 26 people died at Sandy Hook Elementary School.", "compression": 18.2216066482, "coverage": 0.5789473684, "density": 1.027700831, "compression_bin": "medium", "coverage_bin": "low", "density_bin": "abstractive"}

Somehow, you summon the energy to sprint to the finish. Or hobble. You didn’t know if you could, but you did, and here you are, at the end of the marathon. Your marathon. In two minutes’ time, you will be at the finish line.\n\nCrossing it, your face contorts into tears of disbelief and a giant, silly grin. You fall into the arms of an official who gently removes your timing chip from an aching foot and gives you that meaningless, but deeply treasured, medal.\n\nEveryone is hugging, everyone is crying, everyone is in a foil cape, all equally overwhelmed by jubilation, relief and a private acknowledgement, not only of the months of training, but also the dogged willpower that was necessary to achieve the mighty 26.2 miles.\n\nThis is what was wrecked yesterday by the Boston bombs. Photographs show bemused runners denied all of the above as they struggle through smoke, stumbling over the broken glass which is strewn across the single, crucial word painted on the road: FINISH.\n\nThe bombers knew what they were about, too, when they chose the four-hour moment to detonate. For most runners, that time has a particularly magical allure. Let the elite squad deal with its sub-three hour aims; it is the sub-four-hour marathon which the mass field has in its sights. This is because a sub-four-hour target is hard but not unachievable. At about the four-hour mark, scores of runners are crossing the finish line every second.\n\nSo the bombers were targeting the old and the young; the first-timers; the friends doing it hand-in-hand; the runners raising thousands for charities; people with “I’m doing it for Sue” emblazoned on their T-shirts, or with a photograph of a loved one and the name of a cancer charity.\n\nThese were the people, along with their supporters, whom the bombers sought to kill and maim.\n\nBut the very fact that they chose to despoil and wreck America’s oldest and most cherished marathon means their aim will be thwarted.\n\nFor there really is no phenomenon like this wonderful race to unite a great city in a community spirit. From the children handing out jelly beans, to the giant arcs of balloons at mile markers, and the charity stands where people tirelessly wave flags shouting ''Come ON!” to everyone, the altruism and, yes, love exuded by humankind during this gruelling and uplifting challenge is palpable.\n\nWhen the New York Marathon was cancelled last year because of Hurricane Sandy, many runners took part in their own version on the day. A friend told me how New Yorkers came out of their homes, just as they would have done had the official race been run. They stood patiently holding cups of water for sweaty hands to grab; they cheered the runners on. A natural disaster only made the spirit of the city stronger.\n\nI suspect it will be the same for Boston. An act of terror targeted at an event where humanity shows the best of itself will not splinter the community.\n\nNor will it deter the tens of thousands of runners who will observe a period of silence as they line up in Greenwich Park on Sunday before, a few hours later, rather stiffly but defiantly crossing those black mats on the Mall.", "summary": "Marathons bring out the best in runners as well as in the communities that   line the road, whether in New York, London or Paris", "compression": 24.4814814815, "coverage": 0.7037037037, "density": 0.9259259259, "compression_bin": "medium", "coverage_bin": "low", "density_bin": "abstractive"}

That’s why we don’t hunker down. That’s why we don’t cower in fear,” he said at the peak of his speech, during an interfaith service at the Cathedral of the Holy Cross. “We carry on. We race. We strive. We build, and we work, and we love.”\n\nPresidential addresses at commemorative events after national tragedies have become a grim routine for Obama. He spoke in Newtown, Conn., in December; in Aurora, Colo., last summer; in Tucson, Ariz., in 2011; and at Fort Hood, Texas, in November of 2009. His Boston address differed strikingly from those other events, which all followed mass-shooting events. Less somber, less policy-focused and less introspective, he came to Boston to give the city and the country a pep talk.\n\n“You will run again. Because that is what the people of Boston are made of. Your resolve is the greatest rebuke to whoever committed this heinous act,” he told the crowd, which interrupted his address several times with standing ovations.\n\nAt other memorial events, he has quoted Christian scripture for wisdom on how to overcome hardship. Those quotations have usually dwelt on loss and mourning. “He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more,” he said in Aurora, Colo., after the movie theater massacre last summer, a line from the book of Revelation. By contrast, in Boston, he quoted a line from Hebrews that spoke not of loss, but of perseverance and ambition. “Scripture tells us to run with endurance the race that is set before us,” he said.\n\nHe went on to praise the city of Boston, noting its international role and his families own roots in the city, where he and his wife attended law school. “We join you in saying, Boston, you are my home,” he said.\n\nAnd he promised to find those responsible for the blasts, which have so far killed three and injured more than 100. “Yes, we will find you. And yes, you will face justice,” he said.\n\nA full transcript of his remarks follows below.\n\nHello, Boston. Scripture tells us to run with endurance the race that is set before us, run with endurance the race that is set before us. On Monday morning, the sun rose over Boston, the sunlight glistened off the State House Dome. In the Common, in the Public Garden, spring was in bloom.\n\nOn this Patriot’s Day, like so many before, fans jumped onto the T to see the Sox at Fenway. In Hopkinton, runners laced up their shoes and set out on a 26.2-mile test of dedication and grit and the human spirit. And across this city, hundreds of thousands of Bostonians lined the streets to hand the runners cups of water and to cheer them on.\n\nIt was a beautiful day to be in Boston, a day that explains why a poet once wrote that this town is not just a capital, not just a place. Boston, he said, is the perfect state of grace.\n\nAnd then, in an instant, the day’s beauty was shattered. A celebration became a tragedy. And so we come together to pray and mourn and measure our loss, but we also come together today to reclaim that state of grace, to reaffirm that the spirit of this city is undaunted and the spirit of this country shall remain undimmed.\n\nTo Governor Patrick, Mayor Menino, Cardinal O’Malley and all the faith leaders who are here, Governors Romney, Swift, Weld, and Dukakis, members of Congress, and most of all, the people of Boston and the families who’ve lost a piece of your heart, we thank you for your leadership, we thank you for your courage, we thank you for your grace.\n\nI’m here today on behalf of the American people with a simple message: every one of us has been touched by this attack on your beloved city. Every one of us stands with you.\n\nBecause after all, it’s our beloved city too. Boston may be your hometown, but we claim it too. It’s one of America’s iconic cities. It’s one of the world’s great cities.\n\nAnd one of the reasons the world knows Boston so well is that Boston opens its heart to the world. Over successive generations, you’ve welcomed again and again new arrivals to our shores, immigrants who constantly reinvigorated this city and this commonwealth and our nation.\n\nEvery fall, you welcome students from all across America and all across the globe. And every spring, you graduate them back into the world, a Boston diaspora that excels in every field of human endeavor. Year after year, you welcome the greatest talents in the arts and science, research. You welcome them to your concert halls and your hospitals and your laboratories to exchange ideas and insights that draw this world together.\n\nAnd every third Monday in April, you welcome people from all around the world to the hub for friendship and fellowship and healthy competition, a gathering of men and women of every race and every religion, every shape and every size, a multitude represented by all those flags that flew over the finish line.\n\nSo whether folks come here to Boston for just today or they stay here for years, they leave with a piece of this town tucked firmly into their hearts. So Boston’s your hometown, but we claim it a little bit, too. I know this …\n\nI know this because there’s a piece of Boston in me. You welcomed me as a young law student across the river. Welcomed Michelle too.\n\nYou welcomed me during a convention when I was still a state senator and very few people could pronounce my name right.\n\nLike you, Michelle and I have walked these streets. Like you, we know these neighborhoods. And like you, in this moment of grief, we join you in saying: Boston, you’re my home.\n\nFor millions of us, what happened on Monday is personal. It’s personal. Today our prayers are with the Campbell family of Medford. They’re here today. Their daughter, Krystle, was always smiling. Those who knew her said that with her red hair and her freckles and her ever eager willingness to speak her mind, she was beautiful. Sometimes she’d be a little noisy, and everybody loved her for it. She would have turned 30 next month. As her mother said through her tears, this doesn’t make any sense.\n\nOur prayers are with the Lu family of China, who sent their daughter, Lingzi, to BU so that she could experience all that this city has to offer. She was a 23-year-old student far from home. And in the heartache of her family and friends on both sides of the great ocean, we’re reminded of the humanity that we all share.\n\nOur prayers are with the Richard family of Dorchester, to Denise and the young daughter, Jane, as they fight to recover. And our hearts are broken for 8-year-old Martin, with his big smile and bright eyes. His last hours were as perfect as an 8-year-old boy could hope for, with his family, eating ice cream at a sporting event. And we’re left with two enduring images of this little boy, forever smiling for his beloved Bruins and forever expressing a wish he made on a blue poster board: “No more hurting people. Peace.” No more hurting people. Peace.\n\nOur prayers are with the injured, so many wounded, some gravely. From their beds, some are surely watching us gather here today. And if you are, know this: As you begin this long journey of recovery, your city is with you. Your commonwealth is with you. Your country is with you. We will all be with you as you learn to stand and walk and, yes, run again. Of that, I have no doubt you will run again.\n\nBecause that’s what the people of Boston are made of. Your resolve is the greatest rebuke to whoever committed this heinous act. If they sought to intimidate us, to terrorize us, to shake us from those values that Deval described, the values that make us who we are as Americans, well, it should be pretty clear by now that they picked the wrong city to do it.\n\nYou showed us, Boston, that in the face of evil, Americans will lift up what’s good. In the face of cruelty, we will choose compassion. In the face of those who would visit death upon innocents, we will choose to save and to comfort and to heal. We’ll choose friendship. We’ll choose love.\n\nThe Scripture teaches us, God has not given us a spirit of fear and timidity, but of power, love and self-discipline. And that’s the spirit you’ve displayed in recent days. When doctors and nurses, police and firefighters, and EMTs and guardsmen run towards explosions to treat the wounded, that’s discipline.\n\nWhen exhausted runners, including our troops and veterans who never expected to see such carnage on the streets back home, become first responders themselves, tending to the injured, that’s real power.\n\nWhen Bostonians carried victims in their arms, deliver water and blankets, line up to give blood, open their homes to total strangers, give them rides back to reunite with their families, that’s love.\n\nThat’s the message we send to those who carried this out and anyone who would do harm to our people. Yes, we will find you. And, yes, you will face justice.\n\nWe will find you. We will hold you accountable. But more than that, our fidelity to our way of life, to our free and open society will only grow stronger, for God has not given us the spirit of fear and timidity, but one of power and love and self-discipline.\n\nLike Bill Iffrig, 78 years old, the runner in the orange tank top who we all saw get knocked down by the blast, we may be momentarily knocked off our feet, but we’ll pick ourselves up. We’ll keep going. We will finish the race.\n\nIn the words of Dick Hoyt, who’s pushed his disabled son Rick in 31 Boston Marathons, we can’t let something like this stop us.\n\nAnd that’s what you’ve taught us, Boston. That’s what you’ve reminded us, to push on, to persevere, to not grow weary, to not get faint, even when it hurts. Even when our heart aches, we summon the strength that maybe we didn’t even know we had and we carry on.\n\nWe finish the race. We finish the race.\n\nAnd we do that because of who we are. And we do that because we know that somewhere around the bend a stranger has a cup of water. Around the bend, somebody’s there to boost our spirits. On that toughest mile, just when we think that we’ve hit a wall, someone will be there to cheer us on and pick us up if we fall. We know that.\n\nAnd that’s what the perpetrators of such senseless violence, these — these small, stunted individuals who would destroy instead of build and think somehow that makes them important, that’s what they don’t understand. Our faith in each other, our love for each other, our love for country, our common creed that cuts across whatever superficial differences there may be, that is our power, that’s our strength.\n\nThat’s why a bomb can’t beat us. That’s why we don’t hunker down. That’s why we don’t cower in fear. We carry on. We race. We strive. We build, and we work, and we love, and we raise our kids to do the same. And we come together to celebrate life, and to walk our cities, and to cheer for our teams. When the Sox and Celtics and Patriots or Bruins are champions again, to the chagrin of New York and Chicago fans, the crowds will gather and watch a parade go down Boylston Street.\n\nAnd this time next year, on the third Monday in April, the world will return to this great American city to run harder than ever and to cheer even louder for that 118th Boston Marathon.\n\nTomorrow, the sun will rise over Boston. Tomorrow, the sun will rise over this country that we love, this special place, this state of grace. Scripture tells us to run with endurance the race that is set before us. As we do, may God hold close those who’ve been taken from us too soon, may he comfort their families, and may he continue to watch over these United States of America.", "summary": "Barack Obama did not come to remember, to mourn or to commemorate.

In the days after Monday’s tragedy at the Boston Marathon, all sorts of marathon-related medals, jackets, keychains, bottle openers, and other gear has shown up for sale on eBay.\n\nThe Boston Globe reported that as of Wednesday afternoon, there were five active auctions for 2013 Boston Marathon medals at eBay, with bids ranging from $114 to $306. More medals have since surfaced on the site. At least one has already sold for $400, and several others have been bid up over $350.\n\nDan Ashworth, the president of the company that manufactures the medals, told the Globe that he’s “disgusted” with the auctions, especially because the medals being sold may have been stolen in the chaotic aftermath of Monday’s tragic bombings. “It’s just disgusting,” he said. “Everyone was evacuated so the medals were probably just left there for anyone to take.”\n\nIt’s hard to tell if items being sold online are, in fact, stolen property. It’s also difficult to verify the claims of some—but not all—sellers, who state in their listings that at least a portion of the proceeds will go to worthwhile charities, such as One Fund Boston.\n\n(MORE: Boston Marathon Bombings: How to Help — and Avoid Scams)\n\nWhat does seem apparent is that after the attack, interest in Boston Marathon-related merchandise has soared. A recent search on eBay for “New York Marathon” and “New York City Marathon” returned 57 and 77 results, respectively. A search for “Boston Marathon,” on the other hand, turned up nearly 1,500 items. Keychains, jackets, T-shirts, medals, bracelets, collector pins, posters, and more from the marathon this year and in previous years have all been posted this week for auction or at “Buy It Now” prices. Many of the items make no mention of charities in their listings.\n\nOne of the more curious items popping up in a few eBay auctions is a Samuel Adams 26.2 Boston Brew bottle opener. Samuel Adams has offered the special brew, created in honor of the marathon, for several weeks now exclusively in the Boston area, and runners in the 2013 marathon received these openers in their swag bags. Bids on one opener started at $9.99, and shot up near $70 within a few hours.\n\nMany people want to help the victims in Boston, and also visibly show their support for the city. But because it’s often unclear where the money spent in online auctions ultimately winds up, it’s probably wise to steer clear of anonymous sellers. Perhaps instead, check out the Boston Herald’s roundup of a half-dozen items for sale—T-shirts, bumper stickers, keychains—that benefit legitimate charities.\n\n(MORE: Aftermath of the Boston Marathon Explosions)\n\nOr simply give money to charities you can trust.", "summary": "You just knew this would happen.

While this kind of bomb has been used around the world, including in the Mumbai attacks of 2006, it was recently promoted in an article titled “How to Make a Bomb in the Kitchen of Your Mom” in the summer 2010 issue of al-Qaeda’s online magazine Inspire. The Times Square bomber Faisal Shahzad followed the recipe, though Shahzad’s bomb would have killed many more people than the relatively small bombs in Boston.\n\n(MORE: A Marathon Finisher Remembers How It All Sank In)\n\nWho might use such a device? The first possibility would be individuals following al-Qaeda’s recipe, imagining themselves to be furthering its goals by carrying out a “do-it-yourself” attack. Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has been publishing “open-source jihad” instructions and ideas for how to commit low-level terrorist attacks, and Westerners hoping to participate in the “jihad” are urged to carry it out at home. It’s too risky to travel to Pakistan to get trained; jihadist volunteers are too likely to get caught. Instead, volunteers are urged to carry out their own low-level, leaderless attacks.\n\n(MORE: From Jerusalem to Boston: Learning to Live With the Threat of Urban Violence)\n\nBut leaderless resistance actually has its origins in American antigovernment groups, which is the second possibility. The concept was first introduced in the 1980s in a magazine called Survivalist Alert. It was then popularized by neo-Nazis on websites like Stormfront and later picked up by groups affiliated with al-Qaeda. The purpose of leaderless resistance is to evade law-enforcement detection. If small groups, unaffiliated with the movement’s leaders, could act on their own, the virtual organization would be far less vulnerable. This style of organization has been greatly enhanced by the Internet, which allows participants to communicate anonymously. The upside, from the terrorists’ point of view, is that such groups are harder to penetrate and stop. The downside for them (and the upside for us) is that they can’t do as much damage as a terrorist army.\n\n(MORE: Inside the Hunt for the Boston Marathon Bomber)\n\nAnother variable that makes us consider American antigovernment groups is the date of the attack. Patriots’ Day is a sacred holiday for these groups. First, it was the date, in 1985, that law-enforcement authorities invaded the compound of a white-supremacist antigovernment group called the Covenant, the Sword and the Arm of the Lord (CSA). That group, which aimed to fight the “Zionist Occupied Government,” had acquired a crude chemical device and plotted to blow up the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. Ten years later, Timothy McVeigh, who had been in contact with the leadership of CSA, actually carried out the attack, choosing a day close to Patriots’ Day in part because it was the anniversary of the siege of Waco.\n\nSince the late 1960s, Patriots’ Day is celebrated in Massachusetts on the third Monday in April, which this year was on April 15, coinciding with tax day, another important day for antigovernment groups. And while the choice of weapon might make authorities focus on leaderless jihadist groups, it’s worth noting that Inspire magazine’s recipe for pressure-cooker bombs was promoted by the white-supremacist website Stormfront.\n\n(PHOTOS: Aftermath of the Boston Marathon Explosions)\n\nAccording to the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), American antigovernment groups are enjoying a renaissance of sorts. In March, the SPLC sent a letter to the attorney general and the Secretary of Homeland Security warning that “we now also are seeing ominous threats from those who believe that the government is poised to take their guns.” The SPLC warns that the number of conspiracy-minded antigovernment groups grew from 149 in 2008, the year that President Obama was elected, to 1,360 in 2012. Today’s figure exceeds the highest figure from the 1990s by more than 500. The SPLC sent a similar warning to the U.S. government six months prior to the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995.\n\nWhoever the perpetrators of this heinous crime turn out to be, it is one more reminder that there are costs to choosing to live in a free society. Totalitarian rule is a far better bulwark against terrorism (at least inside the country) than is democracy. But few Americans would want to live in the kind of country where this kind of low-tech, apparently leaderless attack could always be thwarted. Unfortunately, this dilemma will be made all the more apparent if investigators ultimately conclude that the terrorists in question were homegrown.\n\nPHOTOS: Front-Page Headlines From Papers Across America", "summary": "The attack was low-tech and apparently leaderless, which points us in several possible directions", "compression": 58.4117647059, "coverage": 0.7647058824, "density": 1.4705882353, "compression_bin": "high", "coverage_bin": "low", "density_bin": "abstractive"}

Stories of athletes’ bravery emerged rapidly after the explosions — many marathon runners sprinted toward the scene to help with the rescue effort, and others rushed to give blood. Former New England Patriots offensive lineman Joe Andruzzi carried an injured woman to safety. Leagues responded with sensitivity — the NBA, for example, canceled tonight’s Boston Celtics home game against the Indiana Pacers. The game has no impact on the playoff race, and with scars (and fears) so fresh, a sporting event in Boston seems inappropriate.\n\nThe Chicago Tribune‘s Sports section swiftly put aside its rivalry with Boston in a very classy design move Tuesday morning, dedicating the front page of the section to Boston sports teams out of solidarity. Ben Revere, centerfielder for the Philadelphia Phillies, taped a “Pray For Boston” message on his glove. He then went and made the catch of the season. Such gestures are inspiring. But they fail to address the somber question that has emerged in the fallout from the tragedy: how can sports fans and spectators feel safe at these big events going forward?\n\nBecause a bombing at a marathon — or any other event — was always the fear. Sports events seem like such an easy target. The attention of the large crowds is focused on the field, on the court, on the race — not on what might be in a trash can next to them. The 1996 Centennial Park bombing at the Atlanta Olympics put American sports on notice, and 9/11, of course, changed everything about security, everywhere. But for sports, the Boston marathon bombing strikes a particular nerve, coming at the finish line of one of the great athletic tests, both for world-class athletes, and for weekend warriors striving for an astounding personal achievement, or running 26 miles for charity.\n\n(MORE: Treating the Marathon Casualties: Inside One Boston Emergency Room)\n\nSo will everything change for sports, again? For the perpetrators of this tragedy, the Boston marathon may have been an ideal event, because 26-mile road races through public streets are harder to secure than, say, the Super Bowl, where everyone comes to one defined location, and first pass through detectors as if headed to the airport gate. David Holley, a Boston-based sports security expert for Kroll Advisory Solutions, a risk consulting firm, expects a more intense pubic safety presence at next year’s Boston marathon. But he doesn’t believe that even the finish line would be cordoned off. “I can’t image that’s going to happen,” says Holley. “It would really change the tenor of the event. The participatory nature of the Boston Marathon makes is special. The people cheering at the finish get so into it, they feel like they’re one of the runners. It’s a hard one to address.” Especially since, Holley says, restricting the finish area would be so logistically difficult, with so many hotels and shops and side streets clustered near the finish area.\n\nHugh Robertson, the U.K. sports minister, says that this Sunday’s London marathon, which has some 37,500 runners, will go on as planned. Around 500,000 spectators are expected to line the streets to watch the race which starts in Blackheath, in southeast London, and ends in the Mall, in the center of the city. The Guardian reports:\n\nThe home secretary, Theresa May, has been briefed fully about the Boston explosions and held a meeting with the MI5 director-general, Jonathan Evans, and the Met’s assistant commissioner for specialist operations, Cressida Dick.\n\nThe threat level to the UK from international terrorism, set by the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre, remains at substantial.\n\nPolice and London Marathon officials are expected to have a series of discussions about security following the explosions in Boston.\n\nScotland Yard is waiting for details to emerge from US investigators, such as who is thought to be behind the blasts, as well as information about the bombs’ construction and the types of explosives used, which will help give clues about whether the perpetrator or perpetrators were inspired by al-Qaida ideology or other forms of extremism.\n\nChief Superintendent Julia Pendry, in charge of policing the London Marathon, said: “A security plan is in place. We will be reviewing our security arrangements in partnership with London Marathon.”\n\nAt many U.S. sporting venues, security is already tight. Holley recalls attending the NCAA Lacrosse Final Four the last two years, and being impressed with how thoroughly venue workers checked all bags. At the men’s basketball Final Four in Atlanta in early April, access to Centennial Park, near the Georgia Dome, required a bag and metal detector search. But even there, I remember noticing that not every pocket of my bag was searched, and my mind turned to fearful thoughts: someone could sneak something in, couldn’t they? Most American sporting events don’t have Olympic-level security; at the Olympics, bags go through scanners.\n\n(PHOTOS: Carnage at the Boston Marathon)\n\n“We operate in a free society,” says Holley. “And that sometimes comes at a cost.” Holley’s advice to anyone now a bit more worried about attending a mass sporting event: “Remain vigilant. Be aware of your surroundings. Keep your eyes open to more than just the events.” Holley expects venues to use more crowd surveillance technology, and maybe more bomb-sniffing dogs. “I have to imagine there will be more engagement between security and fans,” says Holley. “To extent people are acting oddly, or are drinking too much, or are a bit too excited, security will be asking more questions.”\n\nBut the games will go on. And here’s a safe bet: all those people at the marathon finish yesterday — those impacted by the bombs, the first responders, the spectators/runners-turned-heroes — wouldn’t have it any other way.\n\n(MORE: Behind The Hunt For The Boston Marathon Bomber)", "summary": "Expect some sports security changes after the Boston Marathon bombing.

As fearful spectators ran from the scene, a number of bags were left behind; the Boston Police Department is treating all left-behind bags as a “suspicious device.”\n\nDavis confirmed a third explosion at the nearby JFK Library, possibly unrelated, but stated that as of now they have not found another explosive device. The JFK Library is located 5 miles southeast of the blast site near Copley Square.\n\n4:47 p.m.: Other cities across the world are now reevaluating their marathon security plans.

Another explosion was heard by spectators a few seconds later. Initial reports from the said at least two people were dead, and 23 injured. (Watch here for further updates.)\n\nBoston marathon organizers said in a statement on Facebook that the explosion was caused by two bombs: “We are working with law enforcement to understand what exactly has happened.”\n\nBloody spectators were being carried Monday to the medical tent that had been set up to care for fatigued runners. Police wove through competitors as they ran back toward the course. “There are a lot of people down,” said one man, whose bib No. 17528 identified him as Frank Deruyter of North Carolina. He was not injured, but marathon workers were carrying one woman, who did not appear to be a runner, to the medical area as blood gushed from her leg. A Boston police officer was wheeled from the course with a leg injury that was bleeding.\n\n3:45 p.m.: A White House official told TIME that President Obama had been notified of the incident and that the administration was in contact with local authorities. Airspace above Boston was closed late Monday afternoon.

Blood stained the pavement, and huge shards were missing from window panes as high as three stories.\n\n“They just started bringing people in with no limbs,” said runner Tim Davey of Richmond, Va. He said he and his wife, Lisa, tried to shield their children’s eyes from the gruesome scene inside a medical tent that had been set up to care for fatigued runners, but “they saw a lot.”\n\n(PHOTOS: Marathon Carnage: Explosions in Boston)\n\n“They just kept filling up with more and more casualties,” Lisa Davey said. “Most everybody was conscious. They were very dazed.”\n\nAs the FBI took charge of the investigation, authorities shed no light on a motive or who may have carried out the bombings, and police said they had no suspects in custody. Officials in Washington said there was no immediate claim of responsibility.\n\nPolice said three people were killed. An 8-year-old boy was among the dead, according to a person who talked to a friend of the family and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nHospitals reported at least 144 people injured, at least 17 of them critically. The victims’ injuries included broken bones, shrapnel wounds and ruptured eardrums.\n\nAt Massachusetts General Hospital, Alisdair Conn, chief of emergency services, said: “This is something I’ve never seen in my 25 years here … this amount of carnage in the civilian population.

It is held on Patriots Day, which commemorates the first battles of the American Revolution, at Concord and Lexington in 1775.\n\nBoston Police Commissioner Edward Davis asked people to stay indoors or go back to their hotel rooms and avoid crowds as bomb squads methodically checked parcels and bags left along the race route. He said investigators didn’t know whether the bombs were hidden in mailboxes or trash cans.\n\nHe said authorities had received “no specific intelligence that anything was going to happen” at the race.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration barred low-flying aircraft within 3.5 miles of the site.\n\n(MORE: Live Updates From the Boston Marathon Explosions)\n\n“We still don’t know who did this or why,” Obama said at the White House, adding, “Make no mistake: We will get to the bottom of this.”\n\nWith scant official information to guide them, members of Congress said there was little or no doubt it was an act of terrorism.\n\n“We just don’t know whether it’s foreign or domestic,” said Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security.\n\nA few miles away from the finish line and around the same time, a fire broke out at the John F. Kennedy Library. The police commissioner said that it may have been caused by an incendiary device but that it was not clear whether it was related to the bombings.\n\nThe first explosion occurred on the north side of Boylston Street, just before the finish line, and some people initially thought it was a celebratory cannon blast.\n\nWhen the second bomb went off, spectators’ cheers turned to screams. As sirens blared, emergency workers and National Guardsmen who had been assigned to the race for crowd control began climbing over and tearing down temporary fences to get to the blast site.\n\nThe bombings occurred about four hours into the race and two hours after the men’s winner crossed the finish line. By that point, more than 17,000 of the athletes had finished the marathon, but thousands more were still running.\n\nThe attack may have been timed for maximum carnage: The four-hour mark is typically a crowded time near the finish line because of the slow-but-steady recreational runners completing the race and because of all the friends and relatives clustered around to cheer them on.\n\nRunners in the medical tent for treatment of dehydration or other race-related ills were pushed out to make room for victims of the bombing.\n\nA woman who was a few feet from the second bomb, Brighid Wall, 35, of Duxbury, said that when it exploded, runners and spectators froze, unsure of what to do. Her husband threw their children to the ground, lay on top of them and another man lay on top of them and said, “Don’t get up, don’t get up.”\n\n(MORE: Explosions at the Finish Line: Two Eyewitness Accounts of Boston’s Marathon Attack)\n\nAfter a minute or so without another explosion, Wall said, she and her family headed to a Starbucks and out the back door through an alley. Around them, the windows of the bars and restaurants were blown out.\n\nShe said she saw six to eight people bleeding profusely, including one man who was kneeling, dazed, with blood trickling down his head. Another person was on the ground covered in blood and not moving.\n\n“My ears are zinging. Their ears are zinging,” Wall said. “It was so forceful. It knocked us to the ground.”\n\nCompetitors and race volunteers were crying as they fled the chaos. Authorities went onto the course to carry away the injured, while race stragglers were rerouted away from the smoking site.\n\nRoupen Bastajian, a state trooper from Smithfield, R.I., had just finished the race when he heard the blasts.\n\n“I started running toward the blast. And there were people all over the floor,” he said. “We started grabbing tourniquets and started tying legs.

Photos of the men were displayed on easels set up in the briefing room, and DesLauriers said the images would also be published on the FBI’s Web site.\n\n“Somebody out there” knows who the men are, DesLauriers said, adding: “We consider them to be armed and extremely dangerous.” He warned the public: “No one should approach them.... Do not take any action on your own.” He urged people instead to contact law enforcement.\n\nEarlier Thursday, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano told a House committee in Washington that the FBI wants to interview individuals seen in at least one video from the vicinity of the Boston Marathon finish line, but she would not describe them as suspects.\n\nTestifying before the House Homeland Security Committee, Napolitano did not provide details of the men’s appearance or say what the video shows, the Associated Press reported. “There is some video that raised the question” of what the men were doing, she said.\n\nNapolitano said it remains unclear whether the bombs that exploded Monday near the finish line of the renowned race were the work of foreign or domestic terrorists.\n\n“We don’t know yet whether the attack was planned and executed by a terrorist organization, foreign or domestic, or if it was an individual act,” James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence, told lawmakers during a separate hearing on worldwide threats. “Lone wolves, domestic extremists and jihad-inspired or -affiliated groups are certainly determined to attack,” he added in testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n\nWith the investigation proceeding, President Obama, first lady Michelle Obama and members of the Massachusetts congressional delegation flew to Boston to attend an interfaith prayer service, console victims of the bombings and their relatives and thank medical personnel and first responders.\n\nNapolitano spoke a day after the daunting task of sifting through thousands of images of the Boston Marathon bombing site in search of a culprit suddenly telescoped to a video from a Lord & Taylor security camera.", "summary": "The FBI is seeking two men seen in a video, special agent in charge says, calling them armed and dangerous.", "compression": 23.5217391304, "coverage": 0.7391304348, "density": 1.2608695652, "compression_bin": "medium", "coverage_bin": "low", "density_bin": "abstractive"}

The state-run centers were funded by the Department of Homeland Security in the years after 9/11 to address the lack of information sharing among agencies, an issue cited as a factor in the government’s failure to prevent the 2001 attacks.\n\nAs investigators attempt to connect the dots in yesterday’s attack, Boston’s fusion center will allow authorities to tap thousands of law enforcement data sources, along with public data like information from credit agencies, said Mike Sena, president of the National Fusion Center Association, and a state commander of the Northern California Regional Intelligence Center. “This is what fusion centers were built for,” Mr. Sena said.\n\nBoston’s fusion center can help investigators scour for connections among potential suspects, by mining hundreds of law enforcement sources around the region, ranging from traffic violations, to jail records and criminal histories, along with public data like property records, Mr. Sena said. As the investigation widens, and investigators identify suspects, the system can help lead authorities to co-conspirators. For example, the system could flag a possible associate of the suspect by finding a past traffic ticket issued to someone driving the perpetrator’s car.\n\nThe system also allows local investigators to access the federal Homeland Secure Data Network, giving screened personnel access to classified reports from federal agencies like the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Mr. Sena said.\n\nThe fusion center system has its shortcomings, however. Despite their strengths, fusion centers are hampered by the kinds of data silo issues that are familiar to any CIO of a large company, according to Mr. Sena.\n\nFor example, while authorities can access an array of data sources from their own state, data collected in fusion centers in other states cannot be automatically accessed–that information needs to be requested and manually uploaded. And interoperability issues that stem from a multiplicity of proprietary search tools—as well as police record systems built by different vendors–means even information from within California’s 70 data systems, often has to be reformatted before it can be pooled and analyzed, slowing investigations, Mr. Sena said. And for security reasons, classified reports from federal agencies cannot be accessed on the same machines, Mr. Sena said. “Not being able to pull that data together is a huge problem,” Mr. Sena said. “When you are dealing with having to pull in information from 70 systems you can never be that speedy and time is of the essence with real time crime support and investigation.”\n\nLast year, the Senate subcommittee on investigations released a report questioning the effectiveness of the centers in fighting terrorism and protecting privacy.\n\nStill, without the fusion centers, investigators would need to physically pull paper records from dozens of sources, and would need to obtain federal reports through a lengthy request process, Mr. Sena said. “It gives investigators access to an array of data they would not even know about otherwise — it would be stovepiped away.”\n\nWrite to Joel Schectman at joel.schectman@wsj.com", "summary": "The center allows investigators to pool data from federal and local sources to search for relationships among suspects.", "compression": 33.1052631579, "coverage": 0.9473684211, "density": 2.2105263158, "compression_bin": "medium", "coverage_bin": "high", "density_bin": "mixed"}

We will get to the bottom of this and we will find out who did this and we will find out why they did this,\" he said.\n\nMr. Obama didn't describe the explosions as a terrorist attack, saying \"we don't yet have all the answers.\" But after his statement, a White House official said: \"Any event with multiple explosive devices—as this appears to be—is clearly an act of terror, and will be approached as an act of terror.\"\n\nPolice said Monday evening they had no suspects in custody. U.S. officials said investigators were combing through video recordings and the wreckage at the scene to try to determine who placed the bombs. Late Monday, Massachusetts State Police said a search warrant related to the investigation into the explosions was served Monday night in Revere, a Boston suburb, but provided no further details, according to the Associated Press.\n\nFederal authorities consider it a \"potential terrorist investigation,\" Richard DesLauriers, special agent in charge of the Boston office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, said at a Monday night news briefing.\n\nIt was Patriots' Day in Boston, the Massachusetts holiday commemorating the first battles of the American Revolution. Schools and offices are closed, the Red Sox play a day game and the nation's oldest and most prestigious marathon takes over the streets.\n\nRaw video courtesy of WHDH shows one of the bombs detonating near the finish line of the Boston Marathon. Moments later, another blast can be heard down the street. Photo: AP.\n\nMore than half the runners had crossed the finish line at the time of the blasts. Those who hadn't were diverted from the course by police about a half mile from the end, witnesses said. Some 23,000 people had started the marathon, estimated the Boston Athletic Association, its organizer.\n\nThom Kenney, a 43-year-old Army veteran who recently returned from Afghanistan, had just crossed the finish line when the explosions rang out. \"Most of the people were looking back at the first explosion, wondering what it was, when the second explosion went off,\" he said. \"When that went off, we all started calling our families as fast as we could.\"\n\nThe explosions \"sounded like an IED—that was the first reaction that I had,\" he said, referring to the improvised explosive devices used in Afghanistan.\n\nPolice initially reported a third explosion at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum, about six miles away, then said it had been a fire in a mechanical room. But fearing more explosions or other events, authorities urged people to stay inside and avoid large crowds.\n\nThe blasts temporarily halted the city's transportation system as well as flights. The Federal Aviation Administration ordered flights bound for Boston's Logan International Airport to remain at their original airports until late afternoon.\n\nHospitals around the city were flooded with victims bearing a range of injuries.\n\n\"These are very high-force, high-impact injuries so they cause a lot of damage to tissue and to bone,\" said Ron Walls, chairman of the department of emergency medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital. Shrapnel embedded in some patients' skin seemed to be objects from the street, not from any explosive device, he said.\n\nA Massachusetts General spokeswoman said injuries there ran the gamut from \"cuts and scrapes to amputations.\"\n\nAt Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Dr. Stephen Epstein, attending physician in the emergency department, said X-rays of patients showed metal balls that appeared to be ball bearings. \"They look like BBs,\" he said, adding that the balls were distinct from the shrapnel thrown up from debris on the street. Dr. Epstein said some people are at risk of losing limbs.\n\nBoston Police Commissioner Edward Davis called the bombs \"powerful devices\" but declined to describe them further. \"There was no specific intelligence that anything was going to happen,\" Mr. Davis said at a news conference.\n\nOnlookers rushed to help victims after two explosions near the finish line of the Boston Marathon on Monday. The White House described the bombings as 'an act of terror.'\n\nA Justice Department official said Attorney General Eric Holder directed agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to investigate. The chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, Rep. Michael McCaul (R., Texas), said that \"if this is in fact a malicious attack, those responsible will be held accountable.''\n\nBrent Cunningham, 46, had traveled from Sitka, Alaska, to run in the marathon. \"We heard two explosions, and I thought, 'that had a 9/11 feel to it,' \" he said.\n\nMr. Cunningham had finished the race and was walking in Boston Common with his family when the blasts hit. \"It wasn't until we heard sirens, then we knew something had happened.\"\n\nBeth Wolniewicz, a 46-year-old Chicago resident, said she had finished the race about three minutes before the initial blast. \"I saw the first explosion. I never saw the second one go off,\" she said. \"It was loud but more staggering was the velocity of the smoke. It was rising really quickly.\"\n\nPaul Thompson, a spectator who is a sports cardiologist, has researched and published extensively about the health implications of running the Boston Marathon. Driving away from the bloody scene near the finish line Monday, Dr. Thompson couldn't speak without crying.\n\n\"For what? For what?\" said the 65-year-old. \"These people are totally innocent. They're not engaged in combat.\"\n\nA 29-time finisher of the race who first witnessed it as a child at his father's knee, Dr. Thompson said he couldn't imagine the race ever being the same. \"Unequivocally, it will change these events. It will become less fun. Less of a party. I just can't tell you how terrible I think this is.\"\n\nThe London Marathon is scheduled to take place this Sunday. In a statement released by the London Marathon Twitter account, Metropolitan Police Chief Superintendent Julia Pendry said of the coming race, \"We will be reviewing our security arrangements in partnership with London Marathon.\"\n\nOther cities across the country heightened security after the Boston explosions. New York Police Department officials activated emergency measures to protect \"hotels and other prominent locations\" in New York City, spokesman Paul Browne said Monday.

It was not known who owned the car, but the police bulletin could mean authorities fear remaining suspect Dzhokhar A. Tsarnaev, whose brother and fellow bombing suspect was killed early Friday, could have slipped out of the tight perimeter formed by police and FBI agents in the Watertown section of Boston.\n\nWord of the car hunt came during a tense afternoon that saw Black Hawk helicopters patrolling the sky above a search zone where police were going door-to-door hunting for Tsarnaev. A bullet-riddled SUV was recovered in the city's Watertown section and the FBI searched a home in Cambridge where the brothers were believed to have lived. A woman was taken from inside the building, but it was not known if she had any connection to the suspects.\n\nPolice believe the two suspects from Monday's terror attack are Chechen brothers, Muslims from Dagestan, a province in Russia that borders Chechnya. Tsarnaev, 19, of Cambridge, Mass., is believed to be armed and extremely dangerous, and authorities were telling people in much of Boston to remain indoors.\n\n\"We have several other new leads that have just developed with the past few minutes,\" said Massachusetts State Police Police Superintendent Timothy Alben, speaking at a news conference early Friday afternoon. He said police had covered \"60 to 70 percent\" of the perimeter, inside which they believe Tsarnaev is hiding.\n\nPolice believe Tsarnaev could be armed and consider him extremely dangerous. He and his brother — in a vehicle they carjacked from a man who later escaped — led police on a chase through city streets after robbing a 7-11 in Cambridge and killing a Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer, according to authorities.\n\nThe suspects threw explosives from the car and exchanged gunfire with police who were in pursuit as it headed into Watertown, according to the district attorney's news release. Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, was shot several times in the gunfight and pronounced dead late Thursday at an area hospital. But his younger brother escaped, and continued to elude authorities, who were going door-to-door all morning in Watertown.\n\n\"Suspect No. 1 is dead, Suspect 2 is on the run,\" Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick said at a Friday morning press conference. \"There is a massive manhunt underway.\"\n\nPolice also found a car believed to be registered to Tamerlan Tsarnaev in Boston, after earlier issuing a lookout bulletin to Connecticut State police. The Black Hawk choppers were flying above Watertown \"to provide extra eyes,\" sources told The Boston Globe.\n\nDuring the pursuit, a MBTA transit police officer was seriously injured and transported to the hospital, according to a news release. He was identified as Richard H. Donahue Jr., 33, and was being treated at Mt. Auburn Hospital.\n\nSchools are closed, train and bus service is suspended and police were telling residents of neighborhoods including Cambridge, Waltham, Watertown, Newton, Arlington and Belmont to stay indoors.\n\nThe suspects apparently surfaced just hours after the FBI released their imaged late Thursday afternoon, going on a bloody rampage that claimed the life of MIT Police Officer Sean Collier, 26. He was found shot to death in his squad car at 10:20 p.m. Thursday. It was not clear if he was killed before or after the convenience store was robbed, at about 10 p.m.\n\nMoments after the shooting, the brothers carjacked a Mercedes SUV from Third Street in Cambridge and forced the driver to stop at several bank machines to withdraw money. The driver, who managed to get away, told police that the brothers had bragged to him that they were the marathon bombers, law enforcement authorities said.\n\n“The guy was very lucky that they let him go,” Massachusetts State Police spokesman David Procopio said.\n\nAs police were working to activate the tracking device on the stolen SUV, other patrol officers spotted it in nearby Watertown, touching off the dramatic chase.\n\nProcopio said the shooting took place about 10:30 p.m. outside an MIT building. The area was cordoned off and surrounded by responding law enforcement agencies, according to a posting on the university's website.\n\n“The MIT Police serve all of us at the Institute with great dignity, honor and dedication,” Israel Ruiz, MIT’s executive vice president and treasurer, said in a statement. “Everyone here — those who knew Officer Collier, and those who did not — are devastated by the events that transpired on our campus last night. We will never forget the seriousness with which he took his role protecting MIT and those of us who consider it home.”\n\nEarlier Friday, Cambridge police and the Middlesex District Attorney's office said the MIT officer was responding to a report of a disturbance when he was shot multiple times late Thursday. He later died at a hospital. His name was not immediately released.\n\nThe shooting came little more than three days after the twin bombings on the Boston Marathon that killed three people, wounded more than 180 others and led to an increase in security across the city.\n\nClick here for more from MyFoxBoston.com.\n\nFox News' Jennifer Griffin, Jana Winter, Mike Tobin, Mike Levine, Griff Jenkins and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "summary": "Gunshots reported on MIT campus", "compression": 213.2, "coverage": 0.6, "density": 0.6, "compression_bin": "high", "coverage_bin": "low", "density_bin": "abstractive"}

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.\n\nSEAN HANNITY, HOST: Joining me now with more on this and with reaction to the developing story from the House Intelligence Committee, we have New York Congressman Peter King along with the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, Texas Congressman Michael McCaul is with us.\n\nCongressman McCaul, I'll begin with you. It's hard for me to wrap my arms and compartmentalize this, although many seem to be, and that is we have the Boston terror attack on Monday. We have the ricin first attack on Tuesday and another one sent to the president, maybe others on Wednesday. I find -- it's hard for me to separate them.\n\nREP. MICHAEL MCCAUL, R-TEXAS, HOMELAND SECURITY COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: Well, it's similar, in my judgment, to the anthrax attacks after 911, which turned out to have no correlation whatsoever. The evidence in the briefings I have had show that there really is no connection between these two. However, this is a very serious matter, sending ricin to members of Congress, and after 911 we established an outside mail facility where this can be confiscated, and it works, it's protected members of Congress. But the Capitol is on a high state of alert right now.\n\nHANNITY: Congressman King, does it sound like an odd coincidence to you, sir?\n\nCONGRESSMAN PETER KING, R-N.Y., HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE: Yes. But I agree with Mike McCaul. All the law enforcement people I have spoken to, these are two unrelated events. It does remind me back to 2001 where we had the 911 attacks and shortly after that we had the anthrax arriving on Capitol Hill. Again, I think these off-campus facilities, if you will, that stop the mail and protect not just members of Congress and senators, but staff members. I remember Tom Daschle's staff, there are people still sick from the injuries occurred when they inhaled the anthrax. So, it's working. I do think it's a coincidence, Sean. I've not seen any evidence to the contrary.\n\nHANNITY: All right, Congressman McCaul, back to the terror attack in Boston. You were one of the early voices today that were warning people in fact the crazy back and forth in the media, we have a suspect, he's on his way to the courthouse, all of that that was going on, you were saying, no, hold on a second. How do you interpret what is going on right now, and that is the canceled, for example, briefings by the FBI and now law enforcement, they have been distributing the pictures of these two individuals. Your thoughts?\n\nMCCAUL: You know, we don't really know why they canceled it. Of course, CNN got out a little ahead of themselves with some -- you know, when I talked to the FBI they told me we do not have a suspect in custody.\n\nHANNITY: Then how does that happen then?\n\nMCCAUL: Well, I think a couple things going on, Sean. I do think that with the surveillance cameras at Lord and Taylor, with the photos they have obtained from individuals on the street, I do think they have photographs of the suspects. That's just my guess. And I think at some point that's going to be released to the public. There's another theory that they do have somebody in custody that's now cooperating, and that's why they delayed this press conference. But quite honestly, we don't know the answer to that. It would be kind of irresponsible for me to go further than that.\n\nHANNITY: Congressman King, let me go to you. They are distributing pictures of two men to law enforcement that has not been released to the media as we confirmed at the top of the show with our very own Bill Hemmer. We'll check in with Rick Leventhal in a minute. Both have seen the photos and both are describing what I have seen myself and have been described to me by my contacts. What are we to make of that? Does that give us hope that perhaps we are getting closer to finding the people responsible for this terrorism?\n\nKING: Sean, I have great faith in the FBI and Boston police. The FBI is really on this. I have no doubt that it is going to be much sooner rather than later that they are going to resolve this case. There is evidence there, they are going through it. And also, I don't blame them. I don't know exactly why they pulled back on the news conference. But I remember back in 2010 with the Times Square bomber and there was a lack of operational security, people in the administration started leaking out information as to who the target was. And that's when he found out (INAUDIBLE) and he found out he was being targeted and he took off for the airport. And until he heard it on the media from what the administration was leaking out, he had no idea he was a target. So I don't want to tip these guys off if we do know who they are, don't tip them off. And again, maybe they are being followed to see if there are others involved. I give the FBI the benefit of the doubt here.\n\nHANNITY: By the way, you didn't say merchants selling ball bearings and beauty products should notify the police. That doesn't sound like you. I read that you had said that today. Did you?\n\nKING: No, that's what Ray Kelly said in New York, there was a list of products.\n\nHANNITY: Ball bearings, BB guns, pressure cookers?\n\nKING: Sean, no. Sean --\n\nHANNITY: I didn't think you said it. I didn't think so.\n\nKING: Let me tell you what I did say. These products are bought in large amounts by certain people. Ray Kelly wants that reported and some beauty products is what was going to be used to blow up the subways in 2009. They are products that can be used in bombs. If they are bought in certain amounts by certain people, police want that reported. That's something that's on a long way toward preventing a terror attack in New York. You have all these merchants working with the police departments.\n\nHANNITY: All right, guys, thank you both very much for being with us. Appreciate your insight tonight.\n\nContent and Programming Copyright 2013 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2013 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

Seconds later, her life — and the lives of two of her sons — changed forever.\n\n“Ma, I’m hurt real bad,” Norden’s 31-year-old son said from an ambulance en route to Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, according to The Boston Globe.\n\nNorden’s son, who had gone with his older brother to watch a friend compete in the Boston Marathon, said his legs were badly burned in an explosion. His brother had been next to him, the newspaper reports, but they were no longer together.\n\nNorden, a mother of five, would learn within the next two hours that each of her sons had lost a leg from the knee down in the bombings. She declined to release their names without talking to them first, but both are graduates of Stoneham High School and had been laid off recently from their roofing jobs. The elder brother, 33, still lives in Stoneham; the younger in Wakefield.\n\n“I’d never imagined in my wildest dreams this would ever happen,” Norden told the newspaper from outside the Beth Israel Deaconess emergency room late Monday. “I feel sick. I think I could pass out.”\n\nThe girlfriend of Norden’s younger son also suffered serious burns and other injuries in the attack. She was hospitalized at Tufts Medical Center.\n\nNorden, meanwhile, had braced herself for the moment when she would be allowed to see her sons, who were apparently standing next to the 8-year-old boy who died in the blast. As FBI officials and local police left the hospital late Monday, Norden sank her head onto the shoulder of her brother-in-law. A relative then approached, handing her Tylenol she had asked him to buy at a nearby pharmacy.\n\n“Thank you,” she said before burying her face in her hands.\n\nClick for more from BostonGlobe.com.", "summary": "Just prior to that fateful phone call, Liz Norden had been lugging groceries into her Massachusetts home.", "compression": 20.0526315789, "coverage": 1.0, "density": 19.0, "compression_bin": "medium", "coverage_bin": "high", "density_bin": "extractive"}
