In the phone call, he pledged allegiance to ISIS and referenced the Tsarnaev brothers who carried out the deadly 2013 bombing of the Boston Marathon.\n\nAuthorities said the 29-year-old Mateen had twice been grilled by the FBI for possible connections to terrorism, but the probes were inconclusive. He wasn\u2019t charged. A handgun and the AR-15-style weapon he carried into the club were legally purchased. The terrorist bought them within the last week or so, officials said.\n\nKillers in mass shootings used AR-15, thanks to NRA\n\nMateen, who was born in New York, had worked as a security guard and was licensed in Florida to carry a firearm, Florida records show.\n\nPolice said the killer also had some type of device, possibly an explosive, on his body.\n\nThe Islamic State claimed responsibility for the carnage.\n\nIn a sobering address to the nation hours after the shooting, President Obama called the attack \u201can act of terror and an act of hate.\u201d\n\nOrlando gunman Omar Mateen pledged allegiance to ISIS\n\n\u201cThis is a sobering reminder that attacks on any Americans, regardless of race, ethnicity, religion or sexual orientation, is an attack on all of us and on the fundamental values of equality and dignity that define us as a country,\u201d he said.\n\nThe hate-filled attacker died in a shootout with police. Orlando Police Chief John Mina said the shooter was \u201corganized and well prepared.\u201d\n\nMateen was not under investigation at the time of the attack. He had been investigated by the FBI twice since 2013 for possible terrorist ties, FBI Assistant Special Agent in Charge Ron Hopper said.\n\nIn 2013, Mateen was investigated for making \u201cinflammatory comments to co-workers alleging possible terrorist ties,\u201d Hopper said. Nothing was confirmed. The following year he was investigated for ties to Moner Mohammad Abusalha, an American suicide bomber who killed himself in Syria.\n\nNo policy can protect Americans when hate walks in with a gun\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t seem to rise to terrorism,\u201d Rep. Pete King (R-L.I.) added.\n\nThe attacked club went from a place of revelry to a nightmare.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s blood everywhere,\u201d Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer said.\n\nThe carnage began just around closing time at 2 a.m. as about 320 people finished up their drinks and prepared to head home following \u201cLatin Night\u201d at the club.\n\nTexas Lt. Gov. ripped for ill-timed tweet after mass shooting\n\nThe killer first opened fire inside Pulse, mowing down clubgoers. Confusion and chaos overwhelmed the club. Music abruptly stopped and gave way to cries of terror.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just something that you see in the movies but never think would happen to you,\u201d Kenneth Melendez, whose four friends were shot, told the Orlando Sentinel. \u201cAt first, when I heard the shots, I thought it was part of the music, but then we realized it was really happening. I started running and saw someone bleeding from the arm and I was like, \u2018Wow, this is really happening,\u2019 and I kept running.\u201d\n\nHe added that he frequently went to Pulse because it was a \u201csafe environment where you could express yourself ... Not anymore.\u201d\n\nMateen exchanged fire with an off-duty cop outside the club before reentering, firing several more shots and taking hostages.\n\n\u2018The Voice\u2019 star Christina Grimmie, 22, shot dead after concert\n\n\u201cEveryone get out of pulse and keep running,\u201d the club posted to Facebook in the midst of the madness.\n\nChristopher Hansen was in the VIP area when the slaughter began.\n\n\u201cI was thinking, are you kidding me? So I just dropped down. I just said, \u2018Please, please, please, I want to make it out,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cAnd when I did, I saw people shot. I saw blood. You hope and pray you don\u2019t get shot.\u201d\n\nThe gunman holed up in the club, creating a standoff with police.\n\n\u201cWe were just leaving the club and we started hearing the shots,\u201d clubber Anthony Torres told the Daily News. \u201cEveryone was running and screaming.\u201d\n\nAgonizing hours passed until around 5 a.m., when police opted to mount an assault. They detonated two explosives to distract the gunman as 11 officers stormed the club and shot and killed the terrorist. Police, using an armored vehicle, rescued about 30 people still held hostage in the club, Mina said.\n\nOne cop dodged death thanks to his Kevlar helmet, which protected him from a bullet to the head.\n\nPolice announced the shooter was dead just before 6 a.m. and called the incident a \u201cmass casualty situation.\u201d\n\nAbout 12 hours later, bodies were still inside the club, which was perforated with bullet holes. Investigators combing the scene tuned out the constant ringing of phones belonging to the dead who had yet to be publicly identified, according to CNN.\n\nParts of the building had been blasted through, apparently by explosives.\n\nThe death toll exceeded the carnage at Virginia Tech in 2007, where 32 were gunned down, and in Newtown, Conn., where 26 people were killed in 2012.\n\nAs police sought to determine a motive for the latest massacre, Mateen\u2019s father, Seddique Mateen, said that radical Islam was not a factor.\n\n\u201cThis has nothing to do with religion,\u201d the dad told NBC News.\n\nHe said that his son had become angry when he saw two men kissing in Miami several months prior.\n\n\u201cWe are saying we are apologizing for the whole incident. We weren\u2019t aware of any action he is taking. We are in shock like the whole country,\u201d Seddique Mateen said.\n\nA portrait of Mateen as a violent, unstable man began to emerge late Sunday.\n\nMateen inflicted \u201cphysical and emotional abuse\u201d on his spouse during a brief marriage in 2009, the ex-wife\u2019s dad in Edison, N.J., told The News. The killer\u2019s former father-in-law, who asked not to be named, said his daughter divorced the deranged man in 2011.\n\nIn Paris, people rallied in support of Orlando. The City of Light was the site of the November ISIS attacks that killed 130, including 89 in a shooting rampage during a rock concert at the Bataclan theater.\n\nThe shooting at Pulse happened during Pride Month, a national LGBTQ celebration honoring the Stonewall riots in 1969.\n\nThe devastated owner of the club, Barbara Poma, said Pulse had been \u201ca place of love and acceptance for the LGBTQ community\u201d for nearly 15 years.\n\nThe carnage at Pulse follows the murder of \u201cThe Voice\u201d contestant Christina Grimmie, who was shot to death during a meet-and-greet after her Orlando concert Friday.\n\nPulse is approximately four miles from the Plaza Live theater, where Grimmie was slain. Authorities said the two incidents are not related.\n\nWith Megan Cerullo, Ginger Adams Otis","summary":"A terrorist opened fire inside a popular Orlando gay club near closing time early Sunday.","compression":90.8125,"coverage":0.9375,"density":1.9375,"compression_bin":"high","coverage_bin":"medium","density_bin":"mixed"}
